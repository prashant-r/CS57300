1810	1	This restaurant is everything a restaurant should be.  Great food, great service, great value.  First, they made a simple omelette amazing wiht freshly roasted vegtables, home-made (real) hash brown potatoes and even a great bagel.  We each had a spicy bloody mary which was really amazing.  Lastly, we had the beignets as breakfast dessert.  The service was really great.  A very relaxed and enjoyable experience.  The rest of the menu looked great and can't wait to come back again soon.  Run don't wakl to Grand Lux Cafe.
1811	0	It was my first time to visit the place with my friends and we were allstarving after walking along the strip. We were told we had to wait for 30 mins which we thought was ok since we were all tired anyway and we can just sit outside. aft about 40 mins, we checked on it with t he hostess and we were told that we were called already and they will just put us again on the top list. We found this so impossible since we were just outside with othere who were on the waiting list. after about 5 mins, the lady showed us our table. I called oneof the hostess and told her that we are all ready to order. To our surprise she said "I am not your server" and left. We were all shocked and sat for 15mins asking ourselves who to call then when the hostess itself was not interested to help us?! We then called another girl and told her "Can we have someone who can get our orders?".  Foodwise- it was A ok, i ordered the pepper vodka pasta. Proportion is average and foor was freshly cooked. My friend ordered the sundae thing and it was good. The waitress was checking on us from time to time which i think was good considering that we were stil not over with the hostess' attitude. I guess, the servers know that people will still go to their place and they dont have permanent customers since its a tourist's place that is why they are not after good customer service.  My suggestion is, just  go for take out. Dine in experience is terrible!
1812	1	Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.  Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q   Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.    We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:  - Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g    - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g   - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w   The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)  Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the dcor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ   Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.  I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?
1813	1	I saw Lotus of Siam featured on the Travel Channel and it received rave reviews as the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  I visited there for lunch and was not disappointed.  This is not only the best Thai I've had, but one of the best restaurants I've ever visited.  The prices are reasonable enough to ensure that I will be a repeat customer.  During my visit I ordered the fried wontons for the appetizer and the Thai spaghetti for the main course.  The spaghetti was delicious and perfectly prepared.  I visited on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was busy for lunch.  Nevertheless, I got a table right away and the service throughout the meal exceeded my expectations.  After the main course I ordered the coconut ice cream, which was the perfect way to end such a great meal.  The portions were all suitable for one diner, negating the need for takeout boxes.  The menu is large enough and features a varied assortment of Thai dishes that will make you want to come back and try something new.
1814	1	Omg, was there last week and the food is fabulous  delicious and top 3 steak places I have been too. The decor is red-mazing. Went there for an early 4 year wedding anniversary dinner and it was worth every penny. I will definitely be going back on my next trip.the staff is beyond helpful and answer all your questions.   You must try the desserts. Ummmm
1815	0	45 minute wait in line? Really??? Seriously? Ridiculous!!  There were lots of tables either open or needing to be bussed and that line would have moved a LOT better.   Almost missed my cirque show cause of this place. You come to a buffet cause you want to come in sit down, eat, and move on. Well not this place!
1816	0	Just OK. Food was average (being generous), service was uninspired, atmosphere as good. Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere, then go to Dicks to enjoy the atmosphere while enjoying adult beverages. Not a complete bust but the atmosphere can't overcome the blah food......
1817	0	I just returned from a stay at the Mandalay Bay for a birthday getaway. The hotel is lovely, the room furnished beautifully and very comfortable, but the buffet so so so sad and underwhelming for such a nice hotel. Service was slow and unfriendly, had to ask for steak knives, had to ask for drink refills, no forks for crab legs, it was empty in the dining room which might have been a clue on a Saturday night, the shrimp had the look of freezer burn, the prime rib cold, the desserts looked like a Hometown buffet or Golden Corral, the buffet selection was small and nothing stood out, really surprising for such a nice hotel.
1818	0	O m G. Wow. Ordered the Caesar salad w/ chicken. $17. It took like a 1/2 hour-45 mins. Wasn't even an actual salad. Just peeled and very soggy whole lettuce leaves...wth?!! Did not come with croutons but a piece of bread that was suppose to pass for croutons. Waited a while and order the Famous Frozen Hot Chocolate...very sloppy and I was very disappointed. The tower of whipped cream fell over right after I got it and it was just melting down the sides of the glass. On top of the good things I had heard, it's just a fancy $10 ice cold chocolate milk. Might try the Serendipity in NY but def won't come here again. Paid $30 total for lettuce, Sierra Mist and chocolate milk.
1819	1	And here I am thinking that this place was a hidden gem. 82 reviews before me? I'm instantly flaccid. This is like finding out your favorite band is opening for Nickelback.  Ronin burger. Parmesan truffle fries. Lychee soda. Like --- total stomach erection.  Best part is that it's open late... it's going to give Naked Fish a run for its money as a late night poker hangout!
1820	0	Standard buffet. I'm glad we had coupons for $5 off from our IP fun book because there's no way I'd want to pay full price here. We were fairly hungry when we went here so I assumed we'd go to town on everything, but it wasn't anything worth going back for seconds. There was a nice variety of foods, from Mexican and Asian to Amerian and a salad bar (with the bucket of shrimp on ice...literally, there was ice in with the shrimp that I didn't know about until I looked at my plate and had to "fish" [haha] for my shrimp around the ice cubes.) The food wasn't horrible, but I expected more from a name like 'Harrah's.'
1821	1	If you're in Vegas and you're looking for KBBQ, you ABSOLUTELY MUST come eat here! This is the best KBBQ I've ever eaten. Literally everything was really, really good.   We ordered the Gangnam to split between 4, and subbed the miso soup for the kimchi chigae for no extra charge. It was enough food to provide us another meal. I really appreciated that the meats were fresh, had their own flavor, and were not overly salty. Food highlights/must haves: kimchi and bibimbap.   Staff here are super nice and accommodating!
1822	1	Yum! One of my new favorite Burger places in Las Vegas! Long lines, good food. The staff is less than friendly but they do a good job at keeping the line moving and the place clean for as pack as it stays. It's located at The New York New York and its outdoor seating has a view of the *Brooklyn Bridge* and The Strip. Great location for people watching.   The Burgers are fantastic. Fresh made, fresh veggies and a fresh baked bun! Yum! But the real star of the show are the big fat crinkle style cheese fries! These are my favorite cheese fries in town. Do yourself a favor and order some!   Love this place! We'll be back again and again!
1823	0	I AM SO UPSET. I booked a reservation for this hotel thru hotels.com, i chose the "pay later " option and guess what? i get charged now.   Ive been on the phone back and forth with hooters casino and hotels.com, both have blamed each other. Cindy here was trying to help and was giving me some good information so her customer service was not the problem.   I called hotels.com again, finally a guy (his name was jack) who knows what hes talking about and very helpful, decides to get in touch with hooters casino himself after hearing all the run a round this casino gave me, i mean i even emailed them with a screenshot of the email confirmation i received from hotels.com clearly stating I'd be charged at the time of check in (aug) they email me back simply saying i have to deal with hotels.com (poor customer service) .   So this nice guy Jack calls them, gets back on the line with me and GUESS what?? Hooters made a mistake in charging me NOW!!! Hello, ive said that 3 different times! so now theyll refund me the money, but itll take 3-7 business days.. really, u wont even compensate me for the runaround, headache or mistake you made??!! I HIGHLY doubt I'll be staying here at all from now on!!!
1824	0	I cannot say this clearly enough, DO NOT GO! We wasted $86 on this place. Took over 20 minutes to just get our chips and salsa. Chicken Fajitas and Pork Carnitas were bland and tasteless. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, I am a lightweight, I had almost 3 glasses and never felt a thing. My husband used to bartend and seriously doubted ANY tequila was in there, the overwhelming flavor was sweet and sour. No dissing the waitress as she attempted her best with no help from front door staff or bus staff. Yes it was a busy Saturday night but did they not expect that? C'mon already it's the strip! The only part that made us feel any better was the view of the Bellagio water show. Come sit at the bar overlooking it and have water!
1825	0	The beer was the best part of the experience. We were seated at a tiny two top in a corner and couldn't enjoy the fun vibe or decor. The waiter didn't tell us anything about the menu, or bother to ask if it was our first time. We ordered a few different things, and it all came at once. This wouldn't have been a problem if the plates were proportionate to our table, but needless to say the plates made us feel even more crowded. Thinking we could get past this, we were eager to eat. Unfortunately, the food was not tasty. The pozole and pork taco with pineapple were decent, but needed seasoning. The two other dishes were just kind of gross and disappointing. Meanwhile, the waiter never came back and a bus girl took my plate. She was probably trying to clear off the disaster in front of us, but didn't  even ask if I was done. In one last effort to find redemption, my husband ordered dim sum. Our mistake, he ate three of the four because he was hungry, but was again disappointed. The people next to us were also having a bad experience. We love the Cosmopolitan, but will not return to this place. I was really excited to try it out, but it definitely did not meet any expectations.
1826	1	Honestly, I didn't expect much from the generic name, but I was blown away after the first bite. You can taste the difference and can tell they put a lot of love into preparing their burger. Very high quality ingredients and they even serve beer to boot! I'm sold.!
1827	0	I went in first time experiencing very rude service by one female staff.There is simply no knowledge of serving customers in her with very harsh language, arrogant attitude and improper language etc. it's better the owner train their staffs to be more friendly customer oriented.
1828	1	First of all, you would NEVER know how to find this place unless you were specifically looking for it. It's off the strip in an area of town you wouldn't normally want to visit... I mean, unless you're interested in the transvestite strip club down the plaza. Who knows, maybe that's your thing? :)  Anyway... if you do happen to read a review or have someone in Vegas (a cab driver or another local?) recommend this place, it's for good reason... it's simply amazing.   You would never guess from the outside... or for that matter the interior (unless you examined ALL the celebrity pictures up and down the walls of course) that this place was in fact just simply amazing in every possible way. The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely helpful, the food is DELICIOUS and with a full service bar even if the food takes some time (which in my experience it doesn't) you can enjoy some nice drinks.   Best of all? IT'S AFFORDABLE!!! Get five star food for two $$ prices...   Just go here, that is all.
1829	1	We ordered the gangnam combo for 2 and a couple of happy hour specials. Service is fast  Beef toro and prok belly are decent  Mushroom medley is cooked already  Korean choke ken cheese fondue is very tender  Combo for 2 can feed more than 2 by the way A lot of the meat are in the sweeter side though
1830	1	Well let's start with the service. Tamara was our server and we would like to give her 10 stars. The biscuits and eggs were also a 10. They have so many people working everything is do smooth. Packed house but a short wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. We will be back!
1831	1	Great customer service, very friendly and welcoming!! Definitely one of the best Korean Bbq places I have been at in Las Vegas. I love the spicy tuna sushi and Korean prime Kalbi I get that all the time along with the beef torro. Coming here again!!!!
1832	0	If you want a good buffet.... Unless you're on an insanely tight budget and just craving a buffet for the fun of variety, skip this. You'll pay double for dinner elsewhere but it will be a million times better.  On the other hand, if you're just going for a fast, four course meal: salad, soup, entree and dessert you WILL find one yummy option in each genre and be satisfied.  Most of the meats were over cooked and tough or flavorless, or both. Fried chicken was good and the chicken Marsala was too. Roast beef was "just okay", the horseradish sauce was weak sadly.  Mashed potatoes were kind of lumpy. Gravy had minimal taste. They only had one vegetable side that I saw, corn with onions???   Pasta dishes were blah but: shockingly they had *awesome breadsticks* and decent pizza.  Mexican station was nice. Nachos were pretty good with all the fixings. Well. Not all. They had no guacamole.  One major gripe: something insane happened to the guacamole (like maybe a kid put something weird in it) and they refused to put any more out even though the buffet was going to be open two more hours. The lady who pointed it out and a few other people nearby were obviously disappointed. It wasn't worth saving the $ on not putting more out to piss like 5 people off.   I skipped most cold/salad options as food born illness is usually found in uncooked food. My fianc tried the ambrosia salad and liked it and wasn't ill or anything.  The tomato bisque was like a jazzed up version of Campbell's but I liked it. Chicken soup was fairly pleasant as was the Mexican meatball soup.  Desserts. They ran out of the only thing I was interested in: pistachio Creme brle and left the sign out to torture me. Running out so early in the night seems lame. Leaving the sign up to prove it is a fail.   Some cakes were dry (I'm looking at you carrot cake) and others were plushly moist (yes you hot smores lava cake).  They had good drinks (those included in buffet), Mt dew was really fizzy and had plenty of syrup to soda water ratio. Hot chocolate and coffee was available as well as milk and Pepsi products.  Overall, I wouldn't visit again because they didn't have enough well prepared meats or variety of side dishes. However, I don't regret going because we did have plenty of food to nosh on and the smores lava cake saved me from utter dessert disappointment.
1833	1	This place is worth a five star rating!  Not all of Gordon restaurants are equal in quality but this steakhouse is a notch above!!  Had the Beef Wellington and the cauliflower curry soup!!  Both were excellent and flavorful and as other reviewers have said, the service was first class !!
1834	0	We went here to order breakfast at around 6am on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately we didn't even get that far. The waitress who was assigned to our table refused to take our orders because a "new shift" was starting even though we had been waiting for 20 minutes. We talked to the hostess and all she did was tell us which waitress was assigned to our table, the one who still refused to take our order. Given this terrible service we left. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.
1835	1	Best damn pizza I've ever had!!! It's s legit secret as there is no sign advertising it and is tucked away down a small hallway. The pizza ks phenomenal, reminds me of home, greasy New York style slices. Been to Vegas twice now and have had it multiple times. Can't go wrong!
1836	0	i would give this place zero star if i could. (typical raging yelper quote) i am not mad, because i got two buffet for free. i am just mad that i had to spend my dinner eating garbage they serve here when i could've had eaten else where, and be satisfied.  okay, back to realism.  there are quiet bit of selection of food to choose from, and they could look deceivingly good.  but the taste is where my rage-review comes from.  imagine the most horrifying cafeteria food, or your nearby worst buffet food, combine them and you have mgm grand buffet.   their rooms are nice , but this buffet needs to move out to elsewhere.   jesus, how do they maintain this buffet place?  dinner $29.99 - lol, i won't even pay $4.99 to eat that crap again.
1837	1	Every good thing you've heard and read about LOS is true.  I am back from my latest jaunt to Viva and finally had a chance to dine at LOS.  We went during lunch.  At first I wanted to try the buffet, but thought better of trying the authentic Thai that I've always wanted to try.  Besides, the buffet had limited traditional dishes that I could get at Panda Express.  No, I wanted the real deal.  And I got it.  To start, we had the Beef Satay.  The peanut sauce was awesome, a bit spicy and flavorful.  The cucumber salad was crunchy and fresh.  Then the spicy chicken wings.  Why?  Why can I never make these at home?  The sweet-spicy garlic chile sauce was great and the wing itself was crunchy and hot.  Just like it is supposed to be.  I could have made a meal from that alone.  On to the entrees:  MEE KROB RAD NA-Crispy egg noodle topped with straw mushroom, vegetable and gravy. I had it with chicken and it was so good.  even when I pushed it aside, I was still eating from the bowl.  MOO YANG-Marinated charbroiled pork, served with spicy sauce.  Without the spicy sauce, it was a star.  With the sauce, it rang out with high notes.  The service was attentive and warm.  I absolutely enjoyed the experience and will return.  Don't let the area deter you from this gem.
1838	1	It is not a secret anymore!!! So sad!! This place is open until 5am, and that is a beautiful thing! The pizza is reasonably priced considering that it's Las Vegas, and it's a NY size slice. It is PERFECT for a late night snack after Marquee.  Go find it! Good luck! There is no signage!
1839	1	Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention "Peppermill". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!
1840	0	Not impressed at all. After a long night, you just NEED that noodle soup. Since I'm staying in the Cosmo, I noticed this place and performed a quick Yelp. Ive noticed most of the reviews mentioned the service was lacking and the food is good. I had a complete opposite experience, buy anywho. Eddie my server went through the menu and I explained to him all I really want is the noodle soup so he guided me to swallow in the cloud (their version of a Hong Kong wonton soup).  Great, I love wonton soups. So for the price the portion is small. Which I get, branded by a chef and I am in Vegas. The first thing one should do when they are handed noodle soup is to sample the broth. I'm not sure how they make their broth, but I might as well have drank water.  The broth was tasteless  and unsatisfying. To make it a little better, I had to use ALL the chile sauce that accompanied the dish. Which is fine because I enjoy spice, but what about the next person who cannot handle spice?  Anyways, the noodles was overcooked. It lacked the chewiness that noodles should have. Everything else was tolerable.   The only saving grace from me walking out was the server who served me. Eddie thanks for making this meal tolerable.   No Bueno.
1841	1	A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! And we haven't even gotten to our food!!!! The banana nut muffin is EVERYTHING!!!! We also just got our food. Paula said everything on the menu is good and we just ordered 5 different plates and none disappoint!!!! Best way to start off our Vegas weekend!!!!! Paula is super awesome and so are all the staff!!! Ordering a loaf of banana bread for my toddler YUMMY YUMMY!!!! Thank you Egg & I
1842	1	What can I say...I absolutely love this place.  I have been here so many times and have eaten thru the menu probably.  The kalbi burger is by far my fave...the kimchi and spicy mayo...yummy.  I also love the $3 pickles as a starter...and they have boba.  Awesome!  I probably go to this place because although some of the servers this is their first job and need a little coaching they are supernice and its open til 2:00 am most days so another plus on my list.  We live in Las Vegas, the 24 hour place, but too many place close way to early and if you go to eat around 9:00..whoa bad attitude people.  This place is nice too, cause you don't have to trek thru a mob of smokers and bright little machines to get there.  Told you I love this place. :)  My only wish is that they mix up the menu a little more with more specials to suit the season and local ingredients.
1843	0	This is not a "Hilton" hotel.  It was sold a few years ago and the "Hilton" company has been trying to get their name off of it.  I have stayed at a few "Hilton's" over the years and many casinos in Vegas but had never stayed here before but my wife and I wanted to try something new.   Apparently they don't believe in customer service at the LVH.  Maybe they didn't know that there is competition for travelers in Vegas?  They were rude from the moment we checked in until the moment we left.  The people at the front desk, the woman at the players club desk, even at the coffee shop acted like they wanted nothing to do with us.  So rude and uninterested in speaking to us.  My wife and I made it a point not to spend a penny here.  We saw shows at Ceasars Palace, and New York New York, ate at Paris, Mandalay Bay, The Flamingo, and Terribles casino.  We spent quite a bit over the last 3 days but not one penny at the LVH.    The room was nothing special.  I've stayed at 6 different casinos now and would rate the quality of the room in the middle.  Nothing exceptional, nothing horrible about the room itself.    When I've stayed at the Hilton in San Francisco they always treated me with such respect, the other casinos in Vegas made us feel welcome.  I would rather get a $20 room at the Palace Station than go back to the LVH.  I would rather spend a lot more at a casino that I enjoy being at then put one more penny in the pockets of the staff at LVH.  The management clearly is not doing their job if their employees are allowed to treat guests like they do.  When you are on vacation you want the people at your resort/hotel to be welcoming, not act like you are bothering them, they are tired and don't want to see any more guests.
1844	1	I am traveling to Vegas for a convention. I also have Celiacs so I was afraid to eat anywhere for fear of being "Glutened". I was lucky to find this restaurant my first day here so I came back everyday for lunch. I am happy to say that the food was not only Delicious, but healthy for my food restrictions. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is casual but fun and clean. I highly recommend!
1845	0	The only thing still consistent with this place is the great music. Everything else has turned to poop. Nice try with Tao Beach, but seriously.. Lose some of the tables and make a dancefloor that people can actually use.  They've decided to fill every last nook with tables and it's taken away from all the great spots to have a conversation. It also felt like they haven't paid their electrical bill, cuz there were definitely spots in the club that felt like blackholes. Would it take much to put a small light in those areas?!  Also, the carpet is disgustingly sticky and the stairway to Tao Beach is ridiculous.  Maybe my ideal clubbing experience has changed, but I don't think so. We shouldn't have to wait over 1hr for a table, when we arrived at 10:30pm. My money has chose to go elsewhere.
1846	1	These are seriously some of the best burgers I have ever had.  I don't know how they do it but the meat is out of this world delicious and tender and the sauces are really good and usually ask for them on the side.  They even have turkey and salmon burgers. Would love to try them all.
1847	1	Thomas Keller can do no wrong.  Everything I tried for brunch was uhhhmazing! It is located on the 10th floor of the Venezia tower so you get a mini-view if you get a seat near the window.  The Croque Madame had the perfect salty bite.  You get a ham and cheese sandwich, toasted and buttered to perfect.  To top it off you get a sunny-side up egg. Calories-Smalories. You cannot skimp on this greatness.  Break into the yolk and ZOMG... sauce to moisten the sandwich and to mix in with the sauce that reminds me of hollandaise.  Comes with a side of fries but you can ask for potatoes or fruit.  The sandwich is somewhat heavy so the size is perfect for a brunch meal.  The Sourdough Waffle was also amazing.  You don't need to extra syrup or butter because the waffle is by itself sweet enough.  It is topped with pecans and apples so it feels like you are eating a pie instead of a waffle.  The sourdough flavor is light but only if you nibble the edges of the waffle that is not topped with the sauce.  Raspberry filled beignets were also a great appetizer.  The waffle was light and pretty crumbly.  The raspberry jam was not overly sweet so the sugar coating makes it a bit that isn't overpowering.  I loved the feel of this restaurant in addition to the service and the coffee.  Yes, the coffee.  I don't know what coffee they brew but it wasn't sour tasting and I kept wanting refills. A must try when you are in Vegas and looking for a superb brunch location.
1848	0	We tried this place about 2 years ago for dinner and I recalled the food was pretty good so this trip we stopped there for lunch. The location is awesome, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains which our daughter loves. So we get there and I ask the hostess if we could get a seat outside in the front. She doesn't smile, isn't pleasant one bit and asks, well, are you going to be eating?  Um, what do you think we came here to just sit at lunchtime?  She stands there looking puzzled for about 20 seconds, then finally took us to the seats without saying anything.  The waiter was cool but man, the food sucked - I had burrito and hubby had combo plate.  He asks for spicier salsa... we charge extra for that... jalapenos?  we charge extra for that.... really? You're charging 14 bucks for a burrito and you can't throw us some lousy jalapenos??  Never coming here again that's for sure... terrible hostess, terrible food at high prices.
1849	0	I've been coming here for many years when planet Hollywood was the Aladdin... it was amazing... sadly no more... its slowly been going downhill... I came here tonight with family who are visiting from overseas.. very disappointing... it'll be a long time before I return
1850	0	WORST PLACE EVER.   I was hungry and wanted a drink and an outdoor place to sit. My boyfriend and I sat down and ordered two margaritas. $12 per. - that isn't the bad part.   Because I was desperate for a snack I ordered the cheapest appetizer on the menu- chips and salsa for $8!   EIGHT DOLLARS! For nachos you would get free anywhere else. And they were so greasy I couldn't eat them. You have to understand I love junky food, but this was SO bad. Just disgusting.   This place gets one star because I HAVE to give it something to rate it.  In all fairness, the server was nice and the location is good (across from the Bellagio fountain) but save your money and buy a 6-pack, some tostitos and sit out on the sidewalk if you want a good view of the show.   Is this what you wanted, Sammy Hagar?
1851	0	Please, please, read the other reviews and think about this before you even think about setting foot in this establishment.  All the negative reviews are very true.  If you've been to another Brazilian restaurant, this will be a huge huge disappointment.  To boot, it is overpriced for the food quality and variety -- think about it, if over 50% of the diners have half-off certificates, it's because they're tourists and have never eaten here.  I apologize for being so negative, I usually try to find the good in establishments but there isn't much good here.  The best part of my dining experience was my server, Cynthia (she was absolutely awesome!) and the fried cod (from my seafood option).  Yes, the fried fish was the best part in a Brazilian restaurant.  My experience as a diner started out, on a 105-degree day, of the maitreD insisting on seating me as the 2-person table at the far end of the bar (farthest away from servers too!)-- facing the mall hallway and 100 feet away from the outside doors facing the heat.  When I noticed the heat and sweated immediately, she told me that it was airconditioned (as if it was my imagination).  This was early, too, around 530 p.m. with restaurant 80% empty.  Not only did the meat servers ignore me (being out of the way), but I began sweating even more (hey youre splurging for a supposedly nice meal in a nice restaurant on vacation, that aint right).  I politely asked my server if it was possible to move somewhere cooler and after much discussion with the maitreD (who acted all surprised-shocked that I didnt like my table, doh), they allowed me to move inside where it was 15 degrees cooler at least.  I wish I could say that the dining experience was tremendous free there on.  I really wish.  But other than my server's attentiveness, it was god-awful.  Honestly for what I ordered (the churrascaria with the surf and turf), I would have been better served by dining at a nice casino buffet like Planet Hollywoods for half the price (take the prime rib, carved turkey carved ham plus the middle-eastern meats and add the seafood dishes with the various salads/desserts and it's 10x better).  Specific reasons why I am so negative: 1. Horrible Logistics -- Instead of having 3d red-yellow-green wood that a customer can place on a table to indicate whether he wants servers to bring meat, this restaurant uses plastic decals (smaller than a coaster) that lay flat on the table and cant be seen by servers -- thus they breeze right by you table because they cant see that you want food. 2. Poor Maintenance -- They did something to the floors (extra wax???) whereby people were slipping and sliding as they walked to the salad bar or restrooms, which by the way were kinda nasty. 3. Poor Quality and/or Prepared Food -- which is the main reason a) Iced Tea -- I asked for unsweetened regular iced tea and received a fruity version (which can cause dietary isues) as the original server (in the bar) didnt feel it necessary to tell me (I thought the tea was rotting or going bad based on the unexpected "flavoring"). b) Over-Seasoning to mask either the quality or preparation.  Filet mignon that was tasty if you could get by the intense seasoning...after a few bites I couldn't eat it.  Even the ham tasted like a salt shaker -- I mean, ham is the easiest meat to cook with a little seasoning (if at all) to be flavorful.  On the seafood option, the ahi tuna skewers were all over the place -- sometime cooked just right, sometimes chewey/overcooked, and so overseasoned it wasnt edible.  Next to the ham, the next easiest (or even easier) item to not screw up is grilled pineapple -- instead, I received thin, tart, hardly grilled pineapple (the kind youd get at Country Buffet).  Even the deep-fried bananas on the salad bar-buffet were soggy and mushy.  Did I speak to management and express these concerns?  No, I figured if they work there and supervise and taste their product, they should have a clue (a manager was going through the restaurant asking patrons regarding their dining experience -- honestly I just wanted to finish and leave and be done with it).  It is what it is....a $20 meal for $50-60.  You decide...but there are so many other wonderful choices for dining in Vegas.
1852	0	Words cannot express how horrible this was!  We made reservations for 5 because we were going to see the Blue man group. They seated us at a booth that was far to small for our party and when I asked the waiter if we could move and was told to go back to the hostess stand to be reseated!?!?!? Customer service, not!!  Guacamole came, and it looked amazing, till you discover the large amount of chips crushed underneath to make the bowl appear full.  Fail.  The queso chorizo appetizer was nothing more than a smear of beans with some cheese melted on top and microwaved till it was almost inedible.  Kids selections, nothing!!!  Mexican is by far the easiest to do a kids version of, so we had to order the 8yo a 14$ plate of cheese nachos because what kid wants a grilled cheese at a Mexican joint!?!?  Other daughter ordered fajitas.  I wish I could post a pic of the rock hard and crumbly tortillas that were served with it. Waiter knew immediately what was wrong, clearly an ongoing problem.  And the sound....  Wear ear plugs and expect to SHOUT all night.  Horrible food, service ect. Surprised the Monte Carlo would have such an awful place.
1853	1	Three of us came here after a night of partying in Vegas.  One of my friends found Egg & I on yelp, so we tried it out.  I had the chicken fried steak. My gf had a stuffed French toast with ham and my friend had an omelette.  Everything tasted perfect!  I would highly recommend this place, and we will definitely come back, the next time we are in Vegas!
1854	1	I love this place!  Yes, it's pricey, but if you want to complain, go to Mickey Ds, ok?  What I will tell you is that you don't need to upgrade to the Kobe beef, go with the Angus beef and you'll get a great burger.    They have composed burger offerings and they have the any way you want it option, which is the way I roll at The Burger Bar.  Great fries, the pass the Mickey D's test.  Don't be shy about calling an audible and going to the onion rings, they are tasty!  The selection of beers is fantastic.  The staff is awesome, they will take good care of you while you're there.  Just go there and I promise you'll have a great burger.
1855	0	This restaurant had a big line to eat and the waiting system here is absolutely horrible. They make you stand in line for over an hour with no pager or any other system which would allow the guests to sit in casino or do something else. Also none of the restaurants in Bellagio including Noodles has a couch or waiting area which would allow the patrons to sit. This reflects a very callous attitude by bellagio where they dont have a couch or a pager system.   The food is OK. The 2 table besides the counter in the back isclose toeach other and there is very little privacy...  So overall a very dissatisfying dinner - 45 min wait with no place to sit and wait,  food is Just vey average and the waiter is very abrupt so cant give any points for service either.
1856	0	Fairly nice atmosphere in miracle mile shops at planet Hollywood. Meat was very dry with "generous" amounts of gristle and fat. Meat either needed salt/seasoning or was incredibly salty and tough. Salad bar was mediocre at best. Mostly bland pastas. Every person who drinks Water is charged $1. Never heard of this policy before. They do not serve tap but rather fancy filtered water - this was to justify the $1. Buffet does NOT include any dessert but did include sliced watermelon.  They offered a $20 beverage pkg for one hour but took 20 min to get first drink.  Food is WAY WAY OVERPRICED unless you have a voucher to redeem in which case you can upgrade to meat selections for about $10 per person and then still NOT a good value !   Nice wait staff.
1857	0	A stinker. You know, I'm having a hard time trusting people's review, especially when a user's average review rating is four to five stars for several hundred reviews. Does that mean the majority of buisnesses are winners? I guess I'm gullible.  Bayside Buffet is a prime example of why I shouldn't be so eager to try a place recommended by Yelpers. And yet, Im writing one, too! Double standards am fail.  Anyway, bitching aside, my lunch here was super meh. 20 dollars paid at the kiosk, then briskly seated facing away the window (wut?), and then hoarded to the buffet line on both sides of the room. Immediately, I had a nagging feeling the experience would be super meh. How? Oh, let's see...the buffet selection is hella small! My college cafeteria offered more food than this -- and at better quality!   So what did I get?  Meats, a few starches, but mainly stuff jammed with protein.  Lambchops: Ugh. Below super meh. The lamb was gamey and foul tasting, an instant spit-out-of-the-mouth-and-eat-somethingelse-to-purge-the-mouth type thang. Minus points. Pork ribs: Wow, surprisingly soft, but lacked flavor. This was the best entree at the buffet. Turkey: Eh, thanksgiving turkey cut in your choice of dark or white meat. The carver was very nice, but the meat quality was very poor. Braised beef: This better be soft, or else I'm leaving! Fortunately for me, the beef was soft, though a weird aftertaste soured my mouth. Flank steak: Worst meat. I couldn't get steak down my mouth, because the texture was way too chewy. TOO CHEWY. Inedible. Even beef jerky is softer than this flank steak. Mash potatoes: Wait, yelpers, you like this crap? Buttery? Yummy? Uh... I give up.   Dessert Forget the banana pudding, the fruit pudding, the cakes, the brownies; the best dessert is the frozen yogurt. YES. Better than McDonalds frozen yogurt, the barometer for tasty, creamy, consistent goodness. The vanilla custard yogurt was by far the best part of the meal...  ...and the saddest part of the experience. Deserts over meats and entrees? Bayside Buffet, you fail.   And, oh, your service sucks.
1858	1	I don't know why I never reviewed this place sooner, but this is the home of some of the best burgers I have ever had, period.  I went there with the bf for lunch, so it wasn't too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth. I liked the fact that each booth had it's own TV. Cute.  The service was fine as well...I don't recall waiting forever or having an issue at all. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw? In any case, screw the service, focus on the burgers!  I love Hubert Keller, so I was definitely expecting something amazing. I ordered the 3 sliders, which were simply DIVINE.  I still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions! If I could only have one last burger before I died, that would be the one.  There were some more expensive burgers on the menu that I had been tempted to try, but since I hadn't ever been there before, I chose to be a bit frugal until I figured out if I approved of the burgers.  Boy, do I approve!  When I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)...
1859	0	So NOT the buffet that I want when I got to Vegas (TAXI!!! quick! take me to the buffet at the RIo!)  After waiting for what seemed like forever in line that morning for brunch, we finally got seated.  Then we went thru the buffet - it was so so.  There was nothing spectacular about the food, nothing interesting, or unusual that would make it stand out - nothing that would make me ever want to come back.    Vegas is about trying new foods, and experiencing things, this was not something that I would consider new - or an experience.  it was just blah.
1860	0	Had heard so much about Pinks Hot Dogs, so decided to get one for lunch today below my hotel at Planet Hollywood on the Las Vegas strip.  After eating there, I checked the reviews and was amazed to find some positive statements.  The hot dogs were thin footlong dogs, just boiled to heat them up.  What little flavor it had was quite bad.  The fries didn't have a bad taste, they had no flavor at all-  neither offensive or enjoyable.  Prices were typical Vegas, which is to say high, the food quality was poor.  I have been struggling to get the flavor, such that it was, out of my mouth for the last 20 mins.  Not at all what I expected and an utter disappointment.  I want to be reasonable but just can't find a basis to even give Pinks two stars.  Stay away and your wallet and stomach won't have to pay as I have.
1861	0	I wandered the Strip with some girlfriends during Memorial Day weekend and stumbled upon Noodles in the Bellagio.   First, the hostesses took a while to seat us despite the fact that there were several empty tables in the restaurant. Once we were seated, and we ordered our food, it took a really long time for it to come out. I'm a pretty patient person, and I would not say gluttony is a deadly sin of mine, but wow the food took SO LONG to come out. If the restaurant was busier I would understand, but wow it took literally more than half an hour after we ordered, and we only had five people in our party. Food was alright...kind of mediocre, I wouldn't come here again (& for more reasons below!). The five of us each got different dishes and they were okay...pretty subpar. I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.  The worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might've had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with "Sorry about that, hope you feel better." ...thanks, NOODLES.  Overall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-  Get it together, NOODLES!
1862	0	We went to breakfast here with excitement for the bottomless mimosas. However, the "bottomless" mimosas were only refilled once and that was after having to ask our waitress for another.   We were surprised to see low prices compared to virtually every other restaurant in Vegas. But, when the food came- it became clear why. The food was marginal at best.
1863	0	We ordered the deep fried oreo sundae. It took a long time to get it. When they finally brought it out, they took it to the wrong table. When we got it, it was melted and the oreos were soggy. My kids tried to eat it, but it just wasn't good. After quite a while, I finally got the waiter to come over. I told him it wasn't good, and that we didn't want it. He took it away, and the manager came over a few minutes later. She wanted to know what the problem was, so I explained that it took too long to come out and when it did, it was goopy and not good. She tried to give excuses and reasons why it sometimes tastes like that. After I told her I just didn't want it, she said she would "take care of it". When we got the bill, she still charged us $9 for it. Full price was $15, so we had to pay for more than half of something that we didn't enjoy and didn't eat. That's the last time we go there. There's just too many choices in Vegas to need to go there again.
1864	0	Guy with the microphone and mohawk was a complete jerk!  Girls were dancing on stage and a friend of mine went up to join.  He told her "get the F* off the stage now or I'll F*ing throw you off".  Since when is it okay  to cuss and be rude to customers?  There were people up on the stage the whole nigh.  Not sure what the big deal was but he could have just asked her.    Rest of the staff was super friendly and great!
1865	0	Food over priced & mediocre, especially the rattle snake/cactus appetizer for $17.95, deep fried & mostly all cactus.  Potatoes are ala carte. Kids screaming so loud, little to no conversation possible, and about the poor bull stuck in a pen, if they are not exercising him, I hope animal rights takes notice!
1866	1	Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, "this meal was a religious experience!"  Highly recommended!
1867	1	Good food with great service! The mushroom burner is a must. Paired together with the "loaded fries" and cookies and cream shake, I couldn't ask for any other meal. Top it off with great a server with a smile, Audrie made this stop worth while. Thank you for making our visit to Shake Shack awesome!
1868	1	Gotta love the gourmet burgers with an Asian twist. Actually got my pal and her friend from Chicago to try the place and it passes the "Chicago Test"...being that everyone I know from there is picky about food...Chinese sausage, 3 kinds of mushrooms or maybe Korean BBQ and Kim chi on a burger sound weird? Maybe but it's REALLY GOOD STUFF
1869	0	The reviews for this place made me afraid to eat here, and overall this buffet was a let down. It was especially disappointing because even though my visit was free, I would have preferred to totally skip this buffet because it honestly wasn't very good nor was it worth the exorbitant price. It reminded me of a Golden Corral/low end chain restaurant, and definitely not a Las Vegas resort/casino buffet.  The good: The desserts were good. Decent coffee too. Sides like mac & cheese were okay. Chicken tika masala was okay too. Decent flavor profiles to choose from but it was like 85% "American food".  The bad: Almost everything fell short of my already low expectations. The hot crab legs were laughably small, overcooked and fishy. The dude serving up the crab legs seemed like he hated his job and was extremely rude to customers that didnt tip him. They were out of crab crackers and didn't even have wet wipes or cloth napkins available to clean off your hands after hand picking the crab. Most of the steam trays were either empty or filled with food that wasn't fresh. There seemed to be a ton of sloppy, visually unappealing food.   I left feeling disappointed and smelling like rotten seafood. I pretty much ate cookies for dinner. I will definitely not be returning.
1870	1	Because we saw Anthony Bourdain eat at Bouchon on "No Reservations" and rave about the food, we put Bouchon on our list of restaurants to visit. And we didn't eat there just once -- because brunch at Bouchon was so tasty on our first day in Vegas, we left Vegas on a high note and visited Bouchon again for brunch on our last day!   The restaurant has a cute, vintage bistro atmosphere with eye-catching tilework. The staff is great at seating guests near the windows by the courtyard during breakfast and brunch. And the homemade butter is so fantastic that you might just eat the butter by itself.   So during our two visits, we ate: -Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious.  -Brioche french toast: incredible! The toast pieces had no sogginess or heaviness; instead, the toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  -Omelette with salad: tasty and fluffy omelette with a fantastic mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was flavorful yet light and was great for breakfast/brunch. -Pastries: this place knows what it's doing with pastries! We ate a chocolate croissant and pecan sticky bun at the restaurant and also enjoyed a macaron from the Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian on the main floor. Don't go anywhere else and order a pastry; get your pastry at Bouchon!  Put Bouchon on your list for Vegas breakfast/brunch places. If it's morning and you're hungry, go to Bouchon, and you will not be disappointed.
1871	1	Best damn burger I've ever had. Kobe beef, bleu cheese and jalapeo bacon. Good gracious me. Fat fries were also yummy. Classic chocolate shake was a delicious dessert. I would like to minus a half star for the crappy pop music that played the entire time.
1872	0	They need to work out the kinks, that's for sure.  Diablo's?  Pray to the devil that you get your food warm and you can see it.  1.  The lighting was SO low up top that they had to turn on the disco lights which were then blaring in our eyes. 2.  Food came out COLD.  No joke.  We had four plates of tacos and all were cold.  The fajitas were sizzling though. 3.  Salsa is excellent.  So good, I asked for a refill.  Um, ok, they charged me $6 for salsa refill.  EXCUSE ME?   4. Drinks were extra strong, but they should be for $10.  And they didn't have Ketel One.  That was a $10 Stoli. 5. Waitress was very sweet and trying really really hard. 6.  Bartenders downstairs (the girls) were absolutely clueless and it took two of them to figure out how to run a credit card--while 5 of us were still waiting to get served.  Thankfully the guy bartender was on the ball and stepped up to the plate.  He also flashed "Blue Steel."  That bartender deserves 5 stars. 7.  I finally complained at the end about the cold food and why were they charging me $6 for salsa when the food they brought out was sub par?  So the manager took off the salsa charge and the $8 chip charge as well.  Besides all that, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I think the downstairs was better.  The hostesses that I encountered were very nice and inquired about our party, what was it for, making small talk.  Overall though, like I said, they need to iron out the kinks.
1873	1	As someone who grew up around NYC, I know good New York Style Pizza. And this fits the bill perfectly. The thin crust has that nice crack to it when you fold it and is crispy enough to hold the end up in a triangle so you can eat on the go. The wait wasn't bad when we went, under 20 minutes from the middle of the unmarked hallway on a Saturday night. That makes me think that unless a ton of folks are ordering whole pies, even a line out the door is under an hour.  I applaud them for not offering ranch - that's some weird midwest or west coast topping that folks put on pizza to mask how awful it is. Unnecessary for NY Pizza!  $5 a slice seems pretty shocking at first, but it is in a hot casino in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd, so I won't hold it against them. $4 for a Coke in a Solo cup is lame, so we bought the 2L bottle for $6.50. What a markup!
1874	0	I normally love Brazilian food, but this place sucked!  You pay $40 per person and a bunch of guys walk around with meat on a skewer and cut off pieces for you.  We had our choice of I think 10 different meats.  Sadly, most of them lacked flavor and just were overly salty.  The salad bar was good however, but still not worth the hefty $40 price tag for some salad and a few pieces of meat.
1875	0	We come here every year for the past 5 years for business.  I've always eaten at this buffet because I like all the veggies and fruit.  I've tried it for breakfast and dinner and in the past has always been great.  I went there last night and it was horrible and not worth $35.00!  Selection was bland and there was an Italian station with Alfredo sauce but no noodles to put the sauce on and it wasn't because they were out if noodles they just didn't have them on the station at all.  There were stuffed Italian shells but they had cheddar cheese grated on them which looked awful.  The other items were dry and the temperature of the soup was barely warm.  Salad bar and next to nothing as far as variety.  Huge disappointment this time and I won't be going back.
1876	0	They gave my friends and I the three worst rooms in Vegas.  One room had trash all over it. We waited over an hour for them to clean it!    The next morning, the kindest, sweetest person in the world got on the phone and complained like hell.  She got us moved into very good rooms.  If they had just given us the nice rooms to begin with, I would be writing a two star review.    But just knowing they would give someone the rooms we originally got is enough to get this hotel a one star review.    Overall the hotel was in poor condition, and I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone, except this one guy down the street I hate.
1877	1	When we go to Vegas, we make it a priority to visit hash house for breakfast or lunch. I recommend thinking outside the box and try something new.  Everything we have ate here has their own twist to it.  The service is friendly and quite attentive considering how busy they are.  Let me summarize with this quote "I dislike biscuits, but I even ate my kids portion, as they were this good.
1878	1	ok hubby was craving burger so I yelp but that morning I was watching TV and they were talking about this place so perfect, the wait is long but of course if bar available you go ahead, the prizes might scared you the most expensive burger is $60, hubby order the Hubert ke that one is $22, I order a caramel latte so good $9.25,and I order the vegas vegan it was big but good also the salad the wedge so good only thing is that I don't like blue cheese but hubby said that it taste better with it. so if you want to eat burget it here just remember is $$$$$
1879	0	I don't get how this place gets good reviews. It's like one of the cheapest (quality and taste wise) buffet that i had in vegas. Total was $60 sth for 2 for that quality of food? It's not comparable to any other hotel buffets for that same price.   The quality of the food is just bleh. Everything from decor to presentation to taste is just very whatever. My usual favorite part of the buffet - dessert section just completely turned me down. C'mon..soft served ice cream??? (not even comparable to souplantations soft served). It's more like hometown buffet quality but hometown is 3 times less the price.   Ahh. Despite the desserts, other food was just not to my taste. It's true that there are a little bit of everything, from american to italian, asian, middleeastern, mexican, etc, but nothing was really that good. Probably the best thing that i had was a piece of prime rib that i got when we first sat down. When i went to get another piece later on, they already got a new chunk of meat, and that second piece was complete RAW, dripping blood.   I've been eager to try this place because i think this is one of the few buffets that i haven't tried in vegas and with pretty good reviews. Not a good decision. I will probably never go back again unless it's free.
1880	0	Very high prices, poor quality food and painful karaoke makes this a mildly entertaining venue. Service is VERY slow; I suspect as a result of goo people spread thin. Consumer expectations are not high coming in but hey...it is an "experience" that out of towers enjoy...once.
1881	0	Customer Service here is awful! The servers literally stood around together talking and laughing and completely ignored their tables. Also they look for every opportunity to upsell you, and when you are not interested in taking a picture that they practically force you to buy they are super rude.   This place is super overpriced for what you get here. The chicken salad was just iceburg lettuce with a little chicken on top/nothing special.   I wouldn't recommend senior frogs if you are looking for good food at a good price!
1882	0	I was in vegas for a convention, and stayed here for three nights.  Let me just tell you, you get what you pay for, except you get a little bit less.  I tried have an open mind when I came here, but started hating this place when I couldn't sleep all night long! I could hear the people on top floor and could hear everything that was going on in the hallway, and because it's Vegas, there was always activity in the hallway all night long! It was so bad, that I had to make ear plugs from toilet paper! The next two nights I left the bathroom and the room fan running all night long for white noise effect- it helped.   The best thing about this place is oyster bar!  Would not stay here again, but will come back to eat at the oyster bar.
1883	0	By the way, the manager contacted me about a week after I posted this review. Said he wanted to make it right...blah, blah, blah. I responded and he NEVER contacted me again. With that kind of service and the amount of awesome restaurants in Vegas, their business has only one place to go...in the ground.
1884	0	We stayed at MGM for the weekend, and didn't have a plan for Saturday brunch. Despite the mixed reviews, we really wanted to do a cheesy Vegas brunch buffet.  The good: We had fantastic service at this buffet! Our waiter was really attentive, and kept the mimosas flowing! He even sent us each home with a "coffee" cup to go filled to the brim with the good stuff :)  The bad:  Long line to get in. Bonus was that we played the $.05 slots and turned $5 into $20 -  enough to cover just over 1/2 of 1 person's breakfast (yes, you read that correctly). Once you pay at the front, you are put into a second line that is divided by table size (1-4pax, 5-9 pax, etc). We were only a group of 3, and the 1-4 line moved fairly quickly. Still took about 20 minutes from arrival to sitting down, despite lots of tables being open inside.  The ugly:  The price for quality of food. You almost can't find a brunch buffet for less than $35, and MGM definitely came in just shy of that. Still ridiculously expensive, but everything is on the strip! The quality of the food, however, was really poor and definitely not worth the money. Powdered eggs, microwaved bacon, soggy sushi, guacamole from a pouch....I could go on but I think you get the idea. While there is a huge variety of food to choose from, none of it was very good.   Wish we'd skipped it.
1885	0	I needed a place to sleep for the night in a pinch, so I booked a room here without reading some of the negative reviews.  Bad idea!   First off, the room was very old with dirty carpeting.   The wannabe flatscreen TV was there as a fixture because its quality was horrible.  Internet connectivity was not free, but available for $13.99 / 24 hr.  Given my experience of how crappy the speed of the internet was at a previous stay at another crappy Hilton property, I opted to not sign up and use my iphone instead.    Lastly, you need to buy ear plugs if you want to sleep at this place because you can hear the elevator rumbling up and down all night long!   It was like staying at a train station!   The room was also very stuffy with an odor of cigarettes and some other junk.    Since I just needed a quick 6-7 hour of sleep and was so tired, I just put up with all this crap.  Otherwise, I would've never stayed here for more than one night.   Overall, it was a very old, stuffy, and noisy hotel and I would not recommend a stay here unless you're super tired and ready to pass out.    The horrid condition of this hotel reminds me of a skanky billionaire inheritant coochi.
1886	1	Food - AMAZING Service - superb Dcor - comfortable & inviting  The lobster macaroni and cheese may have been the best thing I've ever eaten in Vegas. It came with a mini lobster roll (not mentioned on the menu) and included a slice of bacon. When I told our server I wasn't expecting that and that I don't eat bacon, they brought me another mini sandwich sans bacon. While we're on the service, Porsha was awesome. She offered to split all our checks before and kept everyone's tabs in order. Smiled the whole time and was super friendly about recommendations.  The Frozen Grasshopper was like drinking the last of your Thrifty's mint chip ice cream. It was a tasty shake, but maybe not worth $11, $7 or $8 at best even with the Frangelico in there.   I also had the sliders, two tasty lil bundles of joy. The only knock on this place is on the homemade potato chips that came with them. I must have got some from hours ago because they were cold and rubbery. I bet a fresh & crispy batch would be very good there and would be great with any burger.  Next time I'm in Vegas, Holsteins is at the top of my dining list.
1887	1	Decided to come here on a whim with some friends for lunch, and I'm so glad we did!  We ordered the meat lover's set and a couple of noodle dishes.  The meat was delicious and tender and the spicy seafood ramen was amazing.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!
1888	1	Finally made it to Bachi! Surprisingly enough it took a tourist to summon me to come here. He kept blabbing on about seeing Bachi on the food channel and wanted to order what was on tv. Let me just say this place doesn't disappoint.   Oxtail chili cheese fries!!! A serious must have! There's slices of jalapeos and egg yolk in the mix too. It's messy, but a great kind of messy.   We also had some kind of soft steamed dough pork belly slider. Hm... The dough had a weird sweetness to it. My least favorite item.   They are know for burgers (obviously) so we ordered two and cut them in half so we could try both. We had the Miyagi-San and the Kiki burger. Both delicious in their own way, but Miyagi-San was AMAZING! We washed all this down with the plantation style sweet tea with pineapple and mint!
1889	1	Went with some friends who were visiting and I was really excited to try this place. It was definitely a vegas bucket list for me. The space is hidden on the 10th floor of the Venetian and it's kind of hard to find. The restaurant I think is a beautiful open space with a classic French design. The menu isn't too expansive. It's small and the way it's organized can be a little confusing.   We started off with mimosas, escargot, froie grois pate, and the small seafood platter as appetizers. They also served is complimentary bread with the most delicious butter and blackberry jam combination. I loved the escargots . It can with a puff pastry on top to soak up the garlicky oil goodness. I even dipped extra bread in that sauce. The texture of the escargot and flavor was on point. The froie was good but it's was really hard. Like a spoon can stand upright in it. I definitely like the taste of a actual froie filet better but texture of this was good. I give it 3/5 stars.   The seafood platter was a beauty. We couldn't stop snapping pics of it. The lobster is flavored and it was delicious. The texture was a little chewy. The shrimp was also plump and fresh but it would have been "crispier" if you know what I mean. The oysters were delicious!  Both kinds were. Sweet and fresh. Loved them. The mussels were ok. Could have passed on that.  We didn't get our mimosas until after the appetizers and the waitress felt so bad she gave it to us on the house. That was such a sweet gesture. I love it when restaurants comp things for you when service isn't just right.   For main dishes we got the croquet Madame, the salmon plate, the burger and the steak hash which was the special. The croque Madame is so rich and buttery and gluttonous. I don't think I can eat all of that but my friends did. We also upgraded to truffle fries and that was an excellent idea since it was delicious and the biggest hit. I liked my salmon plate. Nothing special and it's something you can make at home though. The steak hash wasn't that great actually. For 30 bucks it tasted like the steak hash I can get at a diner.   Overall it was a great experience and the service was wonderful. Somethings in the menu are superb, some are just good ( standard but not worth the price) and yes guys this place is pricey.
1890	1	Great food, good portions, attentive service and very reasonable prices. I recommend ordering the sesame oil & sea salt for added flavor, regardless the BBQ you order. From the Bulgogi to the Bibimbap, it's one of the best meals I've had in Las Vegas.
1891	0	This is definitely a place for rookies, amateurs and unsophisticated diners. The food is way overpriced. Probably has a lot to do with the branding, marketing and all the environmental fluff (distractions). We literally waited 20 minutes to be seated. No one acknowledged that we were even standing there. First and only time I will ever eat at this amateurish chain restaurant.
1892	0	This place is alright. I've been wanting to try it just because it's Serendipity and I haven't been to any of the other ones. I didn't have time to wait in line and eat there so my friends just went for the window instead.  My boyfriend and I shared a Cappuchino Frozen Hot Chocolate and one of the dogs. I think it was the regular one. New York Dog? Not sure.   The dog was just that. Just a hot dog. Nothing special.   I hardly noticed any cappuchino flavor in the frozen hot chocolate. I expected it to be more fabulous.  The only thing that really caught my eye here was the fact that they give you Total Rewards points for buying here. And that its plastic utensils are so shiny that they look like real silverware! lol
1893	0	This place gets 2.5 stars.  I went to the original one in NYC and I remember it being more whimsical and better back then. My group of friends wanted to go really badly, and at the end of the day, I ended up going with 3 guys-- all of whom were super stoked to go. Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience for everyone.   ATMOSPHERE Same decor as the one in NYC but not as cramped. The music made it less cute (they were blasting hip hop) and service sucked.  There weren't any tables available so we sat at the bar. Bad idea... (explanation below)  FOOD We came here for the FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE, which was way more magical in our heads. Most people got their own, but my boyfriend and I decided to share because I knew how big the portions were. It's honestly enough for 2 people to share and the bartender even asked my 2 guy friends if they were going to share one, haha.  The frozen hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't anything special. What totally broke our spirits was seeing them make it. Since we sat at the bar, we discovered that the coveted HC was POWDER MIXED WITH ICE... it pretty much shattered our hopes and dreams, making the experience way less enjoyable.  Overall, this place is TOO overrated and overpriced. There are better places to blow your money in Vegas!
1894	0	I don't understand why so many people go to this place... about 18.50 for 2 Saturday breakfast..without drinks    the food is worse than the nearest hometown buffet (half mile away)  i mean food is not THAT bad...is edible but...18.50 for 2 ...breakfast ?  this thing feel like one of those 4.99 buffets in las vegas    I don't understand......every buffet I went to is better than this s..t
1895	0	Embarrassing service.   When you have food runners and bus-persons handling your tables... There is no excuse for you to be hard to reach.   We came in last night, party of 11. Our server took forever to take a drink order. Our food order. Forgot about certain questions we needed answers to. And just down right looked like she didn't give a crap about her job. No personality... Not even a smile from this girl.   She came over only once to see if our food was ok. And not to the entire table either... She came up behind one end of the table and asked with a low voice if we needed anything. Any other time.. We had to stop her from avoiding us to call her over.   Didn't seem like she was busy either. I watched her the entire time. No rush. No pep. The only table she bothered to table touch was the party of 2 in front of us!  The basic job requirement: drink refills, wasn't even done! I purposely waited to see if she would come by and offer me another iced tea. (Because I had a water to get me by) Not once. That cup had bare ice all throughout my meal.   To management: We stiffed Kimberly on a $340 tab... because she didn't deserve the tip that was suggested. She's lucky she got anything at all. I'll tell you who did earn it though, and did get it. Manuela. The bus woman who made sure we had extra small plates. Brought us limes/lemons. Refilled our drinks. Asked how we were doing on more than one occasion. You know. Things our SERVER should have been doing. Things that an ex-server like myself will notice and be annoyed. Annoyed that employees nowadays show no pride in their work.   To everyone else: there are way better restaurants in this town to go to. With better food.
1896	1	This place has been called "The Best Thai Restaurant in North America." I'm not sure how this was determined, but the food is pretty delicious.  And, yes, you CAN get many items veganized here: the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and/or tofu combinations, from Pad Prik King to Chili Mint, to green curry (one of my faves!).  Just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are OK. (Sometimes red curry is made w/ shrimp paste).  The spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name! The phrase "I can't feel my lips anymore, but I can't stop eating this!" is commonly uttered.  You can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too! Sticky rice w/ mango, coconut ice cream (made w/ coconut milk FTW!), fried bananas.... all delish.  Bonus: they have Albarino(!!!!!) and Stone IPA on their drink menu, so I get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal.    They have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity, so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too!  I would recommend a reservation on a Fri or Sat.... but if it's packed you can always trot over to Komol for some excellent chow as well.  I will say this though -- I have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that.  I also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner.  HOWEVER - when I take meat eaters to Lotus, I pretty much insist that they order off the Northern Thai menu.  Only one item on there doesn't have meat, but the dishes are very rarely found on American Thai menus... So just go for it already! If you're an adventurous eater, you'll probably love it.
1897	1	We came here looking for a great burger and a great time and got both.  Walked in and got seated right away and had a nice waiter who was on the ball.   Ordered the Berry Fresh cocktail, the Jalapeno Margarita, and a couple beers (one was the house lager free when you check in with Yelp).   All came to our table very quickly and were quite tasty.  They don't skimp on the alcohol here.     I ordered the Gold Standard Burger and hubby had the Rising Sun.   I loved my burger and if you go upgrade to the Onion rings.  Huge, crispy and delicious!   Hubby was pleased withe his burger as well.  The tomato confit on both of them is awesome.     Food was quick and we were happy for less than 70 bucks in Vegas.    Enjoy!! Can't wait for our Holstein's to open in Portland!
1898	0	What is there to add?   ROOMS  PLUS-Room in the Monaco Tower was clean, the bed comfortable, the water pressure fantastic, and a tub that drained quickly.   MINUS-My brother booked the conference rate....big mistake   CONFERENCE CENTER  PLUS-Lots of rooms and adaptable to the needs of our workshop   MINUS-Time warp to the '80s   CASINO  PLUS-The lights were on and the machines worked   MINUS-Dowdy, rundown, and stank of encrusted smoke   FOOD/OTHER SERVICES  PLUS-None (the lights were on)   Minus-Only went to the buffet for dinner. Better bet: exit the hotel and go to the Peppermill next door.   I'm not quite sure how the Riviera survives in the cut-throat environment of the Strip. They must get enough bus tours and conferences to keep the dollars flowing. It is convenient to Circus Circus and a short walk to the Wynn. If you are looking for an experience of the Strip today, keeping walking. If you want a cheap room in a run down hotel, the Riviera is the place for you.
1899	0	The food was so so but absolutely overpriced. A small braised beef brisket noodle soup cost $14 and 4 tiny seafood soup dumplings cost $12. You can get these in any Chinatown at a half of the price, and they are tastier and more authentic. Nothing special about the noodle and the broth, and the beef was a bit tough. As for the soup dumplings, they didn't have any "soup" inside at all. But overall, like I said, the food was not good, but not terribly bad either. The worst part was actually their service! The only nice thing was their decor.
1900	1	This dinner was a great experience all around.  Our server, Dennis, was top notch and made great recommendations.  Be ready to spend some money (especially if you get a featured app and wine) but the beef wellington for 2 for $100 was well worth it.  It actually brought tears to my eyes it was so unbelievably good!  We had the small seafood tower for an app, split the wellington and truffle mac & cheese and toffee pudding for dessert.  This restaurant is one of the main reasons I will go back to Vegas.
1901	1	My husband and I found this place on yelp and because of the rating And hours, we gave it a shot. Secret Pizza is the BEST pizza we have ever had and my husband is pretty much a pizza critic. So delicious and next time we get to come in town, we will be back!!
1902	0	Would not come back to this buffet again. When deciding to eat at this buffet, we figured that it would more or less be on par with other casino buffets around the same price. I really do not think that's the case anymore. The dinner wait time alone lasted for over an hour, and even the sheer hunger that derives from standing in line couldn't make the food taste much better.
1903	1	Found this place on Yelp and our meal was awesome! For five of us we got a meal for four and it was more than enough. Also, a pitcher of Sapporo for happy hour after 10pm -- can't beat that!   Our server, Donkey, was outstanding as well. Will definitely return and recommend to others.
1904	0	There's absolutely nothing presidential about the West Wing at this hotel. Over the years, we have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip and thought it would be fun to try something new. Pools were nice so had to give an extra star for this. However, the rooms were small, dirty and our sink wouldn't even drain. Yuck.  If you stay at the MGM, make sure you upgrade to a suite -maybe you will have better luck than we did. Would recommend Aria, Caesars or Venetian.
1905	1	GOD, SECRET PIZZA ALWAYS HITS THE SPOT. From the very first time I stumbled upon this "secret" place to every time I've been to vegas after, this pizza spot ALWAYS delivers.   During my last vegas trip, I discovered the magic of CALLING AHEAD!!! Yes you can use any house phone and have the operator connect you to this pizza joint to order your delicious pie. All you have to do is called 35-45mins before you anticipate eating (say....call 35mins before you leave the dayclub or while you are winning big money @ the tables) and VOI-LA....you have FRESH pizza for your drunkchies.   As for which pie to order, cant go wrong with pepperoni but veterans know that the WHITE PIZZA at Secret Pizza is THE BEST!! Mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, drizzled with olive oil with NO sauce!! Thin, CRISPY and DELICIOUS!!!!!!
1906	0	Terrible nothing tasted right. Maybe I'm spoiled because I always eat at the buffet at the Wynn but this was disgusting. What a waste. Cold eggs stale waffles fatty bacon and ham. The only saving grace was  the omelette and even that was mediocre at best.
1907	1	I would love to post a detailed, coherent and eloquent review for this place.  All I can really say is that it was amazing.  I went with a few friends on Friday.  We had a short wait for a table for 5, nothing unexpected.  I got the Kalbi burger and it was the most amazing burger that I've ever eaten.  Everyone else loved their burger (with the exception of the guy who got the Mr Ho's burger; he said it was pretty darn good, but didn't rave to the same extent as the rest of us.)  Our group was in town for 3 days, and we thought about going back on Saturday and even thought about trying to go back for lunch on Sunday before our flights.  It's that good.
1908	1	Everybody here will focus on the burgers, but when you're dining at a Hubert Keller establishment, it's pretty much a guarantee that you're going to get a fantastic entree.  Instead, I will focus on the best milkshake I've ever had in my life - the Chocolate Cowboy.  It was a bit pricey, running me around $11, but the chocolate was of the highest quality and the ingredients were perfectly balanced.  There were mini marshmallows that melted in my mouth instead of adding unnecessary chewiness, and everybody at the table wanted to sample the chocolate whipped cream (I reluctantly obliged).  The high point, though, was the whiskey in the milkshake.  It was perfectly proportioned where I got every bit of the flavor of the whiskey, but it stopped just before the normal "burn" of sipping whiskey would come into play.  It was absolutely incredible.  If you're up to turning the normal $$ of Burger Bar into a $$$, definitely hit up their milkshakes - you won't be disappointed.
1909	1	My wife and I came here and our server was Karla she was really nice and she didn't rush us to order food like some waitress. I ordered the mash potatoe omelette it was just like a bake potatoe except in an omelette. My wife ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a breakfast tostada . The breakfast tostada had refried beans , scrambled eggs , cheese , potatoes , salsa , olives and sour cream . She enjoyed it !! I recommend this place because the staff is friendly , the food isn't expensive and you get a large portion
1910	1	Been here several times for breakfast/brunch, most recently 2x for Thanksgiving. Love their coffee and croque madame. Absolutely delicious. Good breakfast in LV will set you back a pretty penny anyways so if you spend, spend it on Bouchon. Service is very pleasant, other than the hostesses who always seem to behave like they hold keys to heaven. Not specific to this place, most upscale restaurants have this issue. Bar staff is super friendly and likes to have a good conversation. Also met some great people during brunch, so it's never a disappointment. Also, last time they didn't turn away customers who showed up at closing time after brunch which speaks volumes for their level of service. Oh yea, and with a paid receipt from the bistro you get 25% off Bouchon bakery purchase which is facing the strip. Nice treat.
1911	0	Stayed at this hotel because of a Groupon deal. The hotel is extremely outdated. It has a very dingy dirty feeling. The bathtub felt slimy when you stepped in it. The carpets and toilet were dirty as well. The AC worked well but parts were just hanging off. The glass was cracked on the closet door and the T.V. is a dinosaur. The pool is no longer open 24 hours either. The gambling area is so small and needs a major make-over. There are only 2 restaurants in this hotel. The positives are the staff was very friendly, Hooters Restaurant is open 24/7 and for the price it was very close to the strip. Overall, the negatives out way the positives and I would never stay at this hotel again. It felt worse than Motel 6.
1912	0	This hotel is such a waste of money, your better off staying in a no name hotel. I had to get a last minute room on a busy weekend so I really had no choice.  In a nutshell The minute we got to the hotel no one helped us, valet person just watched us open our trunk and get our bags out, until I finally asked him for a luggage cart  Got inside our room, old t.v., trash can was so stained and old it was so gross, the water in the shower kept going super hot to super cold, the t.p. was so thin we went through two rolls in one day, the walls were patched everywhere, our bathroom door handle didn't work, the air conditioner was a wall unit (old), also we could hear the people in the next room through the bathroom vents.  I gambled in the Hooters casino for 1 1/2 hours and never once saw a waitress so I was unable to get a drink.  Bottom line this hotel is a total WASTE of money! There are better places to stay for the money. I should have known better then to say here but like I said I didn't have much choice.  Crappy restaurant and even crappier hotel and casino.
1913	1	I'm back home in Cali and I already want to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here again!  I saw the Ox-Tail Fries on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and I craved it so bad.  It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.  I can't wait to go back again!
1914	1	Great place hidden on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan near the Pool and board game area, you can find it my going down the small hallway with album covers adorning the walls. Very low key old school vibe, reinforced by the pinball machine and old school arcade machine.   The pizza here is great, if your planning on feeding 3 or more people (or two very hungry people) I would recommend just buying an entire pizza, they make it right in front of you and is way more cost effective.   The service and attitude of the employees is great, which is good because of the six times I went there, I was drunk twice and DRUNK once and they still put up with me.   They have a small beer selection as well which consists of PBR (yuck) and dogfishhead IPA (yum), and I believe their menu even has a entry that says "slice and a beer" or something to that nature.  Overall, a great place to start or a end a long night.
1915	0	Cool decor (as you would expect in Vegas). I had the beef chow fun and the noodles themselves were good but the dish overall was pretty bland. All of the other food that was put out on tables next to me didn't look too impressive either. Not impressed.
1916	0	Whatever you do DON'T stay in the courtyard rooms no matter how cheap they are. The walls are so thin you can hear everybody's conversations and you will definitely get woken up by constant loud noise. The room is also outdated. There's also no elevators for the courtyard rooms. Pay the upgrade to stay in the tower. It's so much nicer. The Oyster Bar is the best thing here, but be prepared to stand in line and wait. There's always a lot of people waiting unless you go in the middle of the night. There's only bar seating.
1917	1	I was ecstatic to try this place after seeing Anthony Bourdain dined here.  The hype is real. I love Thai food, but the options here are more unique and the menu is extensive!  The Drunken Noodles Topped with Duck and the Pepper Fried Prawns were amazingly delicious. Everything was piping hot, fresh, and super flavorful.. not just slabbed in sauce or deep fried in batter.  Overall, I would say this place is optimal for larger parties, ideally 4-6 people. We had 10+ people and it was great ordering dozens of dishes and sharing family style. But, I would imagine for a pair - it would be more challenging to try all the variety of dishes!  Inexpensive and absolutely worth it!
1918	1	Best Thai food in North America for sure.  Be sure to order off the back of the menu in the "Chef's special recommendations".  The sea bass Tom Yum tastes like lemongrass scented butter.  The Panang Curry short rib is also one of my favorites.  I have found that it is best to go with a group of 4+ so you can taste various items on the menu.
1919	1	Let's go, let's go, let's go! Super fun, relaxed atmosphere- great place to stop by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the pools. Even better if you fit in a morning workout, because the food is even more glorious without the food-coma-associated-guilt.   Service: Attentive and very helpful  SPIKED SHAKES: Amazing. Can personally recommend Birthday Cake, Cereal Bowl, and Drunken Monkey. What's even more amazing is how good the vegan cinnamon pecan shake was.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers (and as far as the sides go, I'm usually a sweet potato fry fan, but their onion rings came out on top!). Our group also may have ordered a second round of the crispy pork belly buns to take home. I can't wait to go back and try a few more of the "nosh" items (small plates/apps)- poke tostadas or buffalo chicken dip, anyone?
1920	0	Well well well i realize its opening day and it went pretty well for a 2 1/2 hour wait in line and 33 mins to get our food.... All was hood except the smokers who didnt care and at the very end of what could have been at least 4 stars... Riley at the door was belligerent to me when i came back in to get my daughter who was waiting on the food.... Too bad with the prices SO high, the novelty is a 80 cent burger they are 1.59 with cheese. Really guys? You wont make enough? This is a great way to run off your locals, trust me, youll regret it!
1921	1	*Gordon Ramsay fangirl alert*  I've been itching to try this place for a very long time, and it didn't disappoint!  I was told that the Farm Burger was the best, and after reading the description for myself and seeing that this burger involves duck bacon and a fried egg, I was sold. That was one darn good burger!  We didn't get any fries, and instead opted for the milkshake. NO REGRETS! (and I love me some fries...)  The creme brulee milkshake was heavenly! We also got the Oreo and Banana Shakes... they were both good, but my favorite, hands down, is the Creme Brulee milkshake! Get it, you won't regret it!  So switch out the fries for shakes, if you need to make a choice.  Service was great. Our server was cool, but I don't understand why they just leave their iPad menus on the table after taking an order. It was a little stressful with a toddler at the table, because we were afraid he would order something accidentally.  Aside from that, all was good! I would love to come back!
1922	1	Like someone just slapped your tastebuds silly!  I'm a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen, so when I heard one of the newest restaurants he was going to open was going to be in Vegas, I flipped! Finally, I would get to experience one of his restaurants! I've been dying to eat one of his beef wellingtons after watching 10 seasons worth of contestants make it!  The hubby decided at the last second that we would drive to Vegas on Thanksgiving weekend, so getting a last second reservation was IMPOSSIBLE. Thank goodness for the bar area - first come, first serve! We came pretty early for dinner, so there were still a couple of tables open.  When you walk into the restaurant, it's nothing like the Paris casino. So hip, modern and cool!  It was so hard holding back from ordering practically everything on the menu, especially the appetizers! Lucky for us, the hubby and I went with our friend who used to work with the executive chef, Kevin Hee, at a previous job. So, he graciously sent our table extra appetizers!  All of the appetizers we had were great! The hamachi crudo was amazing! I loved the Iberico ham gelee and the caviar and truffle were an extra nice touch! The fried oysters had great texture! Just enough batter to oyster. Loved how they presented the oysters in the original shell! The kurobuta pork belly was so tender and flavorful!   The best appetizer of them all was the FOIE GRAS. *drool* I miss foie gras in California, so being able to eat this was a treat! So buttery and I loved the sweetness of the huckleberry with the salty foie.   The hubby and I shared the beef wellington as our main dish. It was cooked just right! The filet mignon was super tender. I loved the pastry dough on the outside. Don't forget to soak up the red wine demi glace with it! Just be careful though, the combination of the sauce and pastry dough make the steak slide around when you're trying to cut it.   We accompanied our steak with sauteed mushrooms and green been tempura. The mushrooms were good. The bonito flakes made it interesting. The green beans were nice because they were still really bright green and crispy even though they were fried. Great with the garlic aioli it came with!  We were sooooooo full after all of this. I almost skipped dessert. But I took one look at the menu and I just couldn't resist...  STICKY. TOFFEE. PUDDING.  This dessert is miiiiind blowing! From the second it touches your tongue, it's like BAM! Sweet pudding cake smothered with brown butter toffee. OH. EM. GEE. And don't forget the brown butter ice cream! SO GOOD! You will instantly make room in your stomach for this heavenly treat. You MUST get this dessert no matter how full you are!!  I had a great experience here! I would come back to just chow down on appetizers and that amaaaazing sticky toffee pudding!  By the way, sign up for a Total Rewards membership. You'll get a discounted price on all their items (about $1 - $2 off per item). Totally worth it! Can't wait to go back!

It was a good place to gamble and the staff was all friendly & helpful.  Food court was pretty good, great pizza, and pinball hall of fame annex is a nice distraction.  I liked the Riv for both it's history and the effort they're making to make it nicer.  Sadly in late 2012 & 13 my visits weren't so nice.  Drink service is non existent in casino and bars are understaffed with surly bartenders.  Riv is typical of a dying property and it's a shame, so much history here :-(
1924	1	There's a reason that I visit Gordon Ramsay's restaurants whenever visit London or Las Vegas.  You are guaranteed a fantastic experience.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen tasting menu and it was out of this world.  The service, incredible.  Victor (or was it Viktor?) delivered some of the best service I've ever had.    Here's my favorite aspect about the service at Chef Ramsay's establishments that I love (and this goes for all of the help, including the sommeliers as well):  They adapt very quickly to what YOUR mood is.  If you're feeling chatty and casual they open up and chat a bit more when visiting the table.  Feeling private or reclusive, they deliver and pick up silently and only engage when they need to ask a question.  Whatever the mood, they always deliver the same impeccable service.  You never go hungry or thirsty, you make eye contact with anyone (literally anyone) working in the restaurant and they will help you immediately.
1925	0	We waited in a line and paid $28 for our dinner - plus an $11 all-you-can-drink option!   On a positive note the drink option is awesome and they have a literal plethora of food. They also had hot steamed crab legs which was a huge plus. Unfortunately there wasn't anything I thought was delicious. They really had a problem keeping hot food hot and cold food cold. I would not recommend this to anyone with taste buds.
1926	1	I saw in another review that this is owned by The Cheesecake Factory and in hindsight, it makes total sense. Large variety to choose from no matter the time of day (or night), huge portions, super tasty food. My hubby and I come here for the cream of chicken soup, of which I am typically not a fan. The first time I tried it, I was hesitant but since I was guaranteed to love it, I had nothing to lose. The first bite was okay, the second bite was pretty good, by the third bite, I was sold! Now I can't come to LV without having it at least once. Outstanding service every time.
1927	1	Yes, yes and yes. Go up to the 3rd floor and walk forward from the escalators. You'll see an unmarked hallway and then you'll smell pizza... So good. Both their new York style crust and Sicilian are great. The white pie has garlic and cheeses. Ricotta to be specific!! So good. You won't regret this nice little break from the craziness of Vegas!
1928	1	A Vegas staple.  I've been here about 30 times, the galbi is best because they remove it from the bone. This is the best Korean bbq you will find...if you are looking to get a tattoo and your nails done on either side of the location.  I like the constant stream of K-pop and gangsta rap.  Get the Korean galbi and don't forget the enoki mushrooms.
1929	1	I had to update, because we've been back several times since my last review. They've really turned the trashy counter situation around. It's like 95% squeaky clean now, which is great. The pizza continues to be awesome. We have never had to wait for more than a few minutes. I look forward to friends coming to town because that means we get to go to Secret Pizza. Happily upgrading to five stars!
1930	0	Gone downhill recently. No 'fish' at the fishmonger - only cheap crab. Pasta chef never knew what basic dishes were and the selection all round was on the lower end of the scale.  I guess the Mirage hotel is trying to appeal to the budget customer and sets product choice to match.
1931	0	We had decided to eat dinner there last night and we were promptly seated, even though our reservation wasn't for another 30 min. Everything was looking great and smelling great... But then after we were seated in the private dinning area in the wine racks, it was like we were forgotton. The waiter came and took our drink orders and my parents bottle of wine. He returned almost 10 minutes later with water glasses and left. We didn't receive our water until we finally were able to grab someone passing by the door to ask for our water. That was over 20 minutes. And finally the water came. It took nearly 30-35minutes. The wine came and the waters too. We were so thirsty from a long day in the sun. The waiter took out order, and returned to check on us once after that. It took nearly another 40 min to recieve the food we had ordered. My father and little brother ordered the meat rodizuo. The all you can meats brought to you on a sword. Well they waited and waiter after three of use recieved our plates but only 2 of the servers came by and served them just chicken. It wasnt till the three out of five were almost done with our food that, I had to ask the manager for service for the meat ridizuo orders. So we had to sit and wait for them to get served and to eat.   The service was bad and so was the timing. You would think that paying 300 for dinner, that the service would be better. What an awefule experince to have when you hungry and hoping for the service that is expected in any restaurant. We would have been better served at dennys.
1932	0	SLOT WINNINGS TO BUY BREAKFAST   On Thursday night, which was my final night at Vegas, I won $574 in a slot machine at Flamingo. I wasn't planning to have breakfast the following day when I checked out. However I decided to get breakfast for the following reasons: 1) I got a coupon for $5 off for breakfast as a Total Rewards Member 2) Instead of gambling I still can get points by eating here.  After the first plate I lost my appetite. Here's why. The first plate included scrambled eggs. I like my scrambled eggs wet but something was wrong with these eggs. They left a bad taste in my mouth and stomach. Gordon Ramsay said he could tell if a person can cook well if it knows how to cook scrambled eggs. Well someone should've vetted the person or people who cooked theses scrambled eggs. I ended only have three plates of dishes because of the scrambled eggs. The rest of the items were pretty good like ham, sausages, hash brown, and blue berry pancakes. But I always felt to determine how good a breakfast buffet is by how well cooked are the scrambled eggs.   My advice is if you won big money from the slot machine I suggest skip this place and treat yourself to a higher quality restaurant.
1933	0	Lee's is great for late night options when no place else is open. They're open 24 hours which means all the viet sandwiches and boba you want, anytime of day. They are like a lot of boba shops with the same kind of food and drinks. Their boba isn't cooked as long which is why I know a lot of people don't prefer their boba that way but I enjoy it! The one thing I'm not too fond of is their bread used on their sandwiches. Depending on what time of day it is, towards the end of the night, I usually get really hard pieces and eat on the insides of the sandwich. Service takes a while, even when its empty. Their card minimum is $5 so if you're only trying to get something small, bring cash with you.
1934	0	My boyfriend and I needed to grab a quick bite to eat in order to hold us over until the evening, so we stopped by  Pink's Hot Dogs. I've heard of famous Pink's, so I was excited to try out their food, though nothing beats Chicago's hotdogs, so I don't know what I was thinking!   I got the Polish Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog which sounds amazing, however, I couldn't have been more off! It had a very bland taste to it, despite everything that it came with. The hog dog itself is just OK, but the Pastrami pieces it came with were so dry, that it was almost hard to eat it. My bf had a regular hotdog which is hard to mess up, but he was also very disappointed. Besides the less than satisying taste, the prices are incredibly high as well.  It's in a great location inside of PH, which was convienant for us since we were staying across the street, however, I will not be back to Pink's. I have Earl of Sandwich bookmarked for next time, which I regret not checking out due to the stellar reviews it has on Yelp.
1935	1	We walked up and the line was huge! Waited for 20 minutes and it was so worth it. Their Sicilian slices are $8 but they are as big as your head and delicious! Their regular slices are $5 and not as big but still the best slice you'll get in Vegas! We come back every time!
1936	1	Best burgers hands down. Eating at one of Ramsey's restaurants is like my life long pursuit as I've been a big fan of his for years. After studying the menus from 3 Ramsey's restaurants in Vegas, we decided on this one simply because it fits our budget .   Went there at night and the wait was 2 hours, so we came back the next day and tried lunch instead, got in right away. We tried their blue burger and farm burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) and requested them medium rare and they were absolutely cooked to perfection. The outside was evenly cooked and the inside was pink and just melt in our mouths. Ramsey definitely delivered and we were not disappointed!!  The fries were great too with homemade ketchup and aioli sauce. The #4 shake of Oreo and Creme brle was creative and not bad. What was not good was the dessert "sticky toffee pudding push-up pops". They tasted just like vanilla ice cream layered with chocolate cake while they were supposed to be salted peanut ice cream. So don't order that.   Overall though I still give it 5 stars because the burgers were truly the best we had ever had. And now I can finally say I've eaten at one of Ramsey's restaurants.
1937	1	Be ready to WAIT for your food. They cook everything from scratch. That said everything is gigantic and amazing. I have been to hash-house a-go-go several times with family and friends in vegas and it never fails to:  a. Take a long time. b. be absolutely amazing and worth the wait.    highlights include: all of their burgers, massive omelets, and fried chicken and waffels.    i hear there is a new location on south strip but i ve only ever  gone to the one on west Sahara. good thing to do on the way to or from red rock.
1938	1	Brunch at Bouchon is wonderful.   The coffee is delicious. It was pressed perfectly. Or however it was prepared, it was great. The coffee is very smooth and not overpowering. I didn't add any sugar or cream to it tasted just fine without it.   The food is also delectable. Even though it is a small brunch menu, I wanted to order everything. I ordered one of the brunch specials that day- an egg omelet with spinach, tomatoes and cheese. Sides of sausage and toast. It was yum-tastic. I had a taste of the Chicken and Waffles and was slightly disappointed. The roasted chicken was good, but the waffle was a little dry.    I'm so happy there are two other locations in California =)
1939	0	Just went there for a coupon. Wasn't even worth the discount. Glasses were dirty with lipstick still on. No smile from hostess. Only good meat was the sirloin. Other meats were dry. Asked for more sirloin 3 times before it came around again. They charge for water and ice! They just brought the water to the table, no one drank it. You could tell they just refill the water bottles. A dollar a person. We spent most the time waiting for meat to come to the table and we went at lunch time. Supposed to get 12 kinds of meat. We prob got 6. Does grilled pineapple count? Ha
1940	0	i dont think i've ever hated a hotel as much as i hate the westin cauarina las vegas hotel they upgraded me to a full suite on my last stay, complete with three sinks, three rooms, and a walk-in closet they did everything a hotel could do to make it up to me but when you get robbed when you're staying in a hotel, you don't forgive easily
1941	1	Absolutely fantastic. I had bone marrow, seared foie gras, and the hangar steak. Three very rich courses, but paired with the right wine, fantastic!  Service was excellent, their timing and planning was perfect in the way they brought out dishes. 3 courses, an aperitif, wine, digestif, took us about 2.5hrs total. $480 between three people. Will come back next time I am in Vegas.  If you are used to fine dinning and require Michelin stars goes elsewhere. If you enjoy an extravagant, (literally) expertly/perfectly cooked meal, come to bouchon.  Bon appetit
1942	0	This is how I imagine a trendy Chinese restaurant in Helsinki.  White space with massive fish tanks holding hundreds of goldfish (how the hell do they keep the water so clean?) and minimalist touches throughout.  Food however, not so authentic.  The pork buns are better in Beijing (imagine that!); the flat noodle with eggs is tasty, but gooey; and the kung pao chicken is marked as "spicy" on the menu but really isn't.  Thai iced tea is gross in my book, but others love it.    $60 for 2 ppl.  Not worth it.
1943	1	Came here for dinner.  I would rate the food as 4 stars but the service was great so I had to give it a 5.  We had a big group of over 15 people and everyone had a great time.  The server was very helpful in the selection of food choices and beverage choices and made the experience very enjoyable.
1944	1	The portions were huge. My husband had the chicken and waffles. The chicken could have had more seasoning. I have the chorizo hash which could have been better if they turned down the flavor (too salty). The drinks (I had the orange crush; my husband had the blt bloody marry) was on point and we floated around for the rest of the day. We will be back when we come to Vegas!!
1945	0	OK, i never write reviews this long, but it has to be done...  The ONLY reason I stayed at Hooters was because it is right across the street from the MGM where I was attending a hockey game last weekend. Trust me, pay the extra $$ to stay somewhere else!! Somewhere that doesn't have stains all over the carpet, a tub that drains or cigarette burns in the duvet cover!    The girl who checked us in was not very friendly, but the girl who checked us out was.. so it's hit or miss with the staff. Also, I thought Hooters girls were supposed to be hot?? Guess it's slim pickens in Vegas, all the hot girls are working at the Wynn I suppose.  Also, pieces of the laminate hardwood floors in the lobby and hallways are all broken up or cracked and I stubbed my toe really hard on a piece where the shitty floor meets the nasty ass casino carpet. OW! goddamn piece of shit Hooters!!  The elevators are rickety and scary sounding just as other people's reviews say, it's no lie.  The pool is tiny and the towels they give you are an absolute joke! They look like the towels they use to wipe down the bar with! and they are TINY! I'm an average size chick, I had to use 3 towels just to equal ONE normal size towel, also there are black stains all over them like some was just cleaning a car with them EEWW!!  I'm a vegetarian, so we ate one night at the restaurant "The Mad Onion" in the hotel.. grooooossss.  MAYBE the ONLY good thing would be the $1.50 beers at the bar.. but i always bring my own alcohol to Vegas so it didn't matter much to me.
1946	0	Food tasted great, service was decent enough, soda was somewhat carbonated.  The biggest downside: girlfriend and I shared the nachos and we have been fighting off what feels like textbook food poisoning symptoms ever since we left. I mean within 20 minutes of leaving. Undercooked or old meat? I don't know. But it kind of ruined our Friday. Will not be back. Be warned!
1947	0	Stayed here twice and I can def say they aren't consistent. First time wasn't so bad-decent view outside my room, and it was clean and spacious. Second time around, parking-lot view and a smaller room. The room was kinda gross. Stained carpet, smoke smells, I didn't want to stay. Went downstairs to complain and instead of offering a room change, the front desk staff offered to have someone come upstairs to spray my room...what? That's your option for me while you still expect me to occupy the room? (Insert eye roll)...   I probably should've been more firm in my request for a room change, but I was too nice and it got me nowhere.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. But if you want to take your chances and come here in hopes of a good experience, roll the dice. (Insert any other corny gambling/Vegas puns)
1948	0	We decided to try this place since it was a short walk from our hotel. Located next to Harrah's casino, this place has several guards to ensure nobody cuts in line.   Depending on the time of day, you might encounter a line of people waiting outside.  We came here at 6 pm on a Monday evening - a short line of 5 people formed outside; when we left 45 min later, the line was around 20 people outside. Once you're inside, it's another 10-15 people. It took us about 30 min to get our food. Once you place your order, you are given a number, and once your food is ready, they call your number to pick it up. The lady would repeatedly call out the same number for a minute or two until the order was picked up. That certainly didn't add any great ambience to our dining experience.  As of 2/2/15 their menu was not quite extensive as the menu on-line. They don't have fish burgers or onion rings. We tried the original sliders, chicken ring sliders, fries, and onion chips (like onion rings but chopped up). Everything tasted like a 2/5 except for the onion chips which tasted better.
1949	1	Hung over and tired of all the buffets and expensive overrated eateries on The Strip? Well...Hash House a Go Go might just be what you're looking for! It's located off The Strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.  I came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. With a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! Some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: HH Famous Meatloaf, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Corned Beef House Hash, Griddled French Toast, Roasted Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken and Waffles. My favorite was the Griddled French Toast; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. It included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. The combination was absolutely orgasmic and I highly recommend it! Another dish that stood out was the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that I am used to. It was different, but delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.  The portions were humungous and very nicely presented. Their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! Our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!
1950	1	Took my best friend here for her pre birthday celebration! We absolutely were addicted to the popcorn appetizer! Whatever they put on it was like popcorn crack and just had a really great punch to it. It definitely was a cheddar mixed with some type of spice we just couldn't put our fingers on it lol   However, we ordered the buffalo wings....super juicy wings with a great buffalo sauce. I'm not typically a buffalo gal but this sauce was on point!My bestie got a chicken burger which she said was not too dry which made her happy, the boy toy got a classic burger and I got a rising sun! The patty was cooked to perfection and was incredibly juicy! The sweet potato fries were just perfect as well. Overall, the food was actually pretty good I have no clue if we went at a good time or what bit everything was cooked to perfection!   I wanted to try a shake but just couldn't do it. I was wayyyyyyy too full, but the popcorn.....yum yum in the tum tum!!! :) Will be back again this time to try a shake with the buns! LOL
1951	0	The first time I came to White Castle, the line was out the door.  I was excited to try the sliders!  After the first bite, I had no idea what the fuss is about.  The sliders are small and sad looking.  Not much flavor aside from the cheese.  And that's only if you get the cheeseburger sliders!  The original sliders are underwhelming.  The lines are seriously puzzling... is there a secret menu I'm not aware of?!  On the most recent, the hubs wanted to try the chicken rings.  It's a rip off. It's like a nugget, pounded super thin and then they punched a hole in the middle to make it a "ring".  Better off going to Shake Shack or even McDonald's dollar menu.
1952	0	It would be zero stars if there was an option.   I will ever visit this place again. It was not busy when we arrived but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. That should have been my 1st clue to leave.    When we were finally seated the waitress appeared offering water we were already prepared to place our order from waiting so long.  She took our drinks order and about 15 min later the drinks arrived. My drink came in this Palm tree plastic cup hmm ok whatever it taste good so we placed our food orders and waited and waited about 30 min which would have been fine except when they brought the orders out it was the wrong items. I ordered the BLT wrap which was correct but my husband who is super sensitive with his food had ordered the carnitas plate. They bought him tacos. He is a diabetic and was very hungry and edgy at this point. We did not take the tacos the waitress said he ordered tacos my husband said no I ordered the carnitas plate. We said being the check.   Check arrived and they charged me $24 for my drink WHAT it was from the slush machine I was charged $11.25 for the plastic Palm tree cup I told her I didn't ask for the take home cup and didn't want it. She said you can just leave it then.     By this time I had it wrong food order waiting forever to be treated like this. Never again  I will be sure to share my review with others
1953	0	I went here a few days ago and I have to say I'm totally disappointed. I sat at the bar because everyone knows the best service is always from the bartender but that's not the case here. Service was slow and inattentive the bartender wouldn't talk much and appeared to hate his job. I ordered the signature blood orange Margarita and it wasn't that good I've had much better elsewhere. I had the street tacos and it was ok not very spicy but super salty. Rice was greasy and lacked flavor beans were strait from a can. Skip this place there is bunch better in Vegas.
1954	0	funny seems like they rave about the wings, but not the customer, we usually get a local deal for them($5 food credit in the mail).. So we get them now and then, but I must agree , these are dry and not so tasty wings, it is best to put sauce on the side and they do take at least 10-15 mins to take your order and then another 20-30 mins to get them to go... I think they just want you to spend $$ on the their tight slot machines, while you wait for your order???
1955	0	All i have to say is 1 hour check in. WTF!! The rooms where seemingly old & out dated. For a hotel in Vegas I was expecting a slightly more updated room. Our experience was maybe the worst I have had in any hotel. Again, the checkin was ridiculasly long, and I'm not joking when I said 1 hour!! And this was at 12:15am, on a Tuesday! Then we walked all the way to our room which was about a 10 min walk, with 2 kids mind you. Then we get into our room and just get a wiff of stall cigarette air. We specifically asked for a non smoking of course. So we called the front desk from our nasty room and we were on hold for more than 10 min, after being already frustrated and tired we decided to go to the front desk and go straight to the person and made our statement. We finally got our non smoking room, but also got  very uncomfortable beds. I could go on and on, but let's leave it at that. If you don't believe me just try to experince it yourself and you'll see.   I normally don't write this long of reviews but this 1 just took it! And again, I could go on and on. Bottom line, choose a different hotel if staying in Vegas, The Riviera just didn't cut it.
1956	0	Recently stayed in the West Tower. The rooms were renovated with a contemporary look & feel. You're greeted by a frosted glass sink and vanity area. The doors to the toilet and shower were both frosted glass from floor to ceiling. The bed area felt cramped and dark. The one plus was the dvd-equipped TV and the Bose clock radio, neither of which I used but good to have. Still can't complain since they "comp'ed" my three night stay! Of course that's not to say I didn't "contribute" to Las Vegas' sinking economy!
1957	1	My first review ever on Yelp is dedicated to Gangnam Asian BBQ. We ordered the Gangnam Grill for 2 people and had more than enough for my parents and myself. Fair price and great service! Our waiter checked in with us often and made sure everything was going well. For next time, I will be ordering what I like individually. I only really cared for the bulgogi within the entire order. Leaving the restaurant with a full happy tummy!
1958	1	Yep! The expected stellar dining experience only Gordon Ramsay can guarantee!!  For Appetizer, we ordered the "Fuzzy Chicken Wings." Spicy & Tangy w/blue cheese crumbs! They were DAZZLING! Fell off the bone! Hmph!  For the Entree we ordered the "Uber Cheese Burger," -fontina, raclette & goat cheese- I added a fried egg! O. M. G! Superb cooking technique of the meat! It's the first thing you will notice! Very Woodsy! We also ordered the American. Boring, uninspired selection I thought...NOT SO! In fact, after BOTH of those selections I can confirm I will never enjoy any other Burger again after this experience, and if I NEVER eat a burger except here, I'm A okay with that! Oh! Can't forget the Truffle Fries! My God, if you are an Atheist, you won't be after the Truffle Fries! In fact, this has to qualify as baptism! The friggin Truffle Fries are a Divine Spiritual Experience!  Enjoy!!
1959	0	Worse wait I've experienced.  Most people who spend money on the strip are people on vacation.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wasting my vacation standing around.  There was a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with the purchase of an entree, so I went to check it out.  I've seen pictures, and it looked so large and delicious.  Turns out, there was an hour wait to be seated.  I opted to forgo the coupon, and stand at the walk-thru window instead.  Horrible decision.  There were two parties ahead of me, but there were only two workers, so they took the order, made the order, then served the next customer.  The wait took over a HOUR.  I've never had such a horrible wait.    When I got the frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the one for 2.  It didn't look as large in a dinky plastic cup.  In fact, they only put about 2/3s of what they put in the blender in my cup.  The hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  It tasted cheap, like powdered hot chocolate, and blended ice.  I've tasted better frozen hot chocolates, and they are generally made with syrup, for a creamier more integrated flavor.  Overall, I was disappointed with my experience.  It doesn't taste bad, and the decor was interesting, so I give it a 2/5
1960	1	This place is seriously on my top five places I most love and want to return to. I came here on the first night I finally went back to Vegas.   Everything from the atmosphere to the food, and service was just very on point.   The bar is so beautiful, very elongated and prestigious. The bartender was great, you can't really mess up a Black label on the rocks can you? Very impress with the design and set up.   The food here is so fudging good, I mean I was pretty tipsy but I remember the steak being so perfectly good. It melted in my mouth, I believe I had the bone-in-rib eye with the mac-cheese and spinach side to share with my best friend. Mac and cheese was exactly how it should be made, not extra cheesy but like enough to make the noodle saucy and still textured. Love the spinach sauteed with that parmesan cream. Yum! I am not too sure what he got, but remember trying it and was like damn that's bomb.   The service was really good, from the beginning to the end they were very accommodating and friendly. To my recollection.   I honestly love this place for so many reasons; mainly the conversations me and my bestest always share over bomb dinners, and just overall being totally overwhelm with happiness here.
1961	1	My husband and I are in Vegas and we have a craving for Korean food.  This place has a lot of great reviews and we thought to give it a try.  It was absolutely awesome!  Well worth it!  The staff is attentive and very friendly.  Definitely a place that we will visit again when we come back to Vegas.
1962	1	OPMG can't go wrong with anything! But my favorite is the the hammered pork tenderloin eggs benedict with cream sauce!!!!!!!!!1 Its bigger than my freaking head and I only finished 2/3s of the damn thing soooo goood.... the bacon cream sauce they put on that thing is so delicious.... and my runnder up is not the sage fried chicken eggs benedict pretty massive and really good..... Coming here is my new Vegas tradition!
1963	0	So I was really excited to try this place.  I heard Pink's is the #1 hot dog, better than gray's papaya in new york.  I seriously couldn't wait after I saw that Planet Hollywood had a Pink's there.  i decided to order something different.  It was the hollywood dog or something like that..  I didn't like it at all.  I didn't want to try anything else because I paid $16 for a hot dog, fries, and a coke.  They get two stars because I liked the fries.  My friends told me I would like the los angeles location better.  Hopefully it is better than Las Vegas.
1964	0	Stayed here on Sunday July 24th. I come to Vegas quite often and I've stayed at numerous hotels on the strip including Planet Hollywood, The Venetian, Treasure Island, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Bally's, Caesar's and some off the strip and downtown.   I expected so much more from The MGM given that they're supposed to be one of the top properties on the strip.   Of all my Vegas visits I have never experienced a more horrendous check in process. We waited over an hour to check into the hotel! The line was so long that the hotel was giving out free alcoholic drinks! It was a mess! They charge for parking now as well. If you're going to charge people all this money, the least you could do is make it more convenient for them! We were also unable to check out from the TV and waited over 20 minutes to try to check out via phone so we had to again wait in line to check out!   The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are spacious, I loved the bathrooms. The pools were very kid and adult friendly.   However, I will never stay here again because it does not seem like they have their stuff figured out when it comes to customer service.
1965	1	The food is great along with the customer service.  When you go there you have to try their banana nut muffins they are the best. It is not overpriced and you will get a lot of food for your money.  Friends come to visit and I have recommended this place to others and they too enjoyed it.
1966	1	Bouchon was the last on our list of restaurants to try before we flew home, so we came here for brunch.  I wish it would've been the first on our list because I would've been here everyday for every meal.  Let me start off with the hostess, who just went above and beyond.  We had our luggage (carry on sized) with us and instead of us dragging them around to our seats, she lugged our heavy bags and checked them for us.  Once seated, she even took my messenger bag and placed it in the seat next to me so it wouldn't get dirty on the floor.  The waiter service was all smiles - I don't remember a time when our waiter came by and he didn't smile.  I ordered the Croque Madame, which was good.  My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles - that dish is amazing.  The chicken was delicious and the waffles were light, crispy and airy.  We also ordered some of their pastries, which I highly recommend as well.  I just wish I'd seen their daily pastry specials prior to ordering what was on their menu.  Make sure you know what's available for the day, they have chalkboards on the walls.  What a fantastic little bistro.  I only wish I could have savored everything they had to offer.
1967	1	I absolutely looooove this place!!! Everything that I have ate here is absolutely delicious..even the tap water tastes good.   Ive stayed at the Venetian for one of my most recent trips to Vegas for a week..and just about every meal I had was from the Grande Luxe!  What Ive had:  appetizers: Mini chili cheese hot dogs: hit the spot after a night of dancing and drinking at Tao, but dont u dare eat em if u cant hold down ur alcohol and food! Duck pot stickers: very yummy, dont really taste the duck meat due to the spicyness of the Hoisin sauce.  Asian Nachos: such a cool play off regualar nachos. the chips are made from wontons and there is peanut sauce which is spicy and sweet! there is also wasabi cream which is daring but sooo good. This appetizer is good with a beer!  Burgers: The Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it!  Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger.   Entrees: Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you! Fried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders!  Crispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet.  Chicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.  Pizza:  Margherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.  Simply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it.  The presentation for all the plates are lovely.  Super Pro: Open 24 hours!!
1968	0	Big Disappointment! If I can give it a ZERO, I would!  Paid $900 for the VIP Bottle Service.  We went in a group of 10.  We were treated so very well at beginning and at the end,they basically acted like they did not know who we were. They talked to us by name the entire time.  I was tossed out because I felt sick, went up stairs to the bathroom and threw up.  It was so hot and humid from the fully packed people.  People were literally dancing on each other on the dance floor.  I wonder if they even have a limit capacity.    Anyways, a bouncer escorted me up to the casino floor, told me that they had found my husband and that he would come out to meet me at the entrance.  15 minutes later, he never showed up.  Asked one of the bouncer by the door to see if he knew what was going on.  He said to ask the other guy which turned out to be the guy who took us to our VIP booth and accepted our credit card.  Asked him if he remembered who I was, he said yes.  I told him that the other bouncers told me my husband would meet me by the entrance.  Showed him, my "X" on my risk cause I couldn't go back in.  His face totally changed and acted like he did not who I was and said he has no way of helping me.  Really? He was the guy who took our card and escorted us.  My party was literally looking for me all the place.  They asked the clean ladies upstairs by the bathroom and they said they never saw me.  LIARS!     Trust me, they are just after your money.   Once you are done with the drinks from the bottle service, they are done with you.  No need to tip their waiters and waitresses.  They are so fast to clean your booth and bring in a new group. They brought new ppl to our booth while my party was still their.  Their VIP sucks so bad.  They put 2 parties in one both.  There's no separation between you and the other party.  If you request, they'll just have a bouncer to come in between.    Take your money elsewhere.  And for an actual real VIP booth, please go somewhere else unless you want to pay $$$$ and share with someone else.  We went to Encore the second night and had a blast their.    Love the Venetian, hate the CLUB!
1969	1	Don't let the look from outside fool you. It looks much better inside. Apart from the tiny entrance, this place is actually huge and clean. Food quality is  great, however it come in small quantities compare to other Thai restaurants. Thai Ice Tea and Ice Coffee also great, too.
1970	0	If you are accustomed to staying at the quintessential Vegas resort such as the Wynn, MGM, Aria, or even the Monte Carlo then you will have a lot of compromises. Casino smoke hits you as you walk through the door, the bathroom tub did not drain easily (although they did send someone to fix it quickly), and the room service sent us 8 wings when we ordered 10. A friends room smelled of mold and our view was of a dumpster and gorgeous Tropicana parking lot. If you want some cheap Vegas thrills such as a cheap room, $3 and $5 black jack that is close to the strip then this may work for you. Remember that in Vegas you get what you pay for.
1971	0	Only giving it two stars because we got a comp for it. Otherwise I might have given it one. We went for lunch and there were not very many offerings set out. We could hardly find anything we wanted to eat. What we did try was very non-remarkable. Had a couple of decent desserts but as far as the food, BLAH.
1972	0	First time at restaurant and got a deal for dinner on Groupon for $65.00. I made reservations for 7:15. We got to the restaurant at 7:05 checked in with the front and they told me it would be about 10 minutes. No problem we went and walked out in front entrance for there was no seating inside but stood by the entrance. We had been waiting for about 15 minutes and walked back to check if they had our table. The front desk asked me for my name again and said have a seat. About another 15 min go by and they finally called our name and the host had told me they called my name already and another guest had taken our reservation and was seated. No big deal it happens. We waited almost 10 minutes for a server to come to our table. He just took our drink order and walked away. We sat there not knowing what to do here and how it worked. He finally came back after a long time had passed with our drinks and explained what we were to do. Salad bar was very delicious but I was not too happy about the meat carvers. We only had 4 to 5 different carvers to table and 2 was the same meat. We has one serving of shrimp/salmon and one serving of pineapple. We were there for an hour and a half from time of checking in and eating. I would never pay full price for this place for customer service is terrible. The salmon was absolutely terrible. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
1973	0	ASSHOLES...WOULDN'T ACCEPT A REAL DRIVERS LICENSE... Tall skinny D-bag bouncer wouldn't let me and my 3 girlfriends in because he thought my real AZ drivers license was fake. I'm 27 and we were even on the guest list!! He wouldn't tell me why he wouldn't accept it, just said nope you gotta leave. I've never in my life had a problem with my ID. I asked to talk to the manager and he claimed he was the manager. Yeah right, what managers gets stuck working the line?!! I suggest they actually train their bouncers on how to examine IDs and not to be douche bags! I'm sure this place is wayyyyyy overrated anyways!
1974	1	This place has a nice concept and it's well executed  Trendy Asian Burger Spot  Sit down restaurant  It's not cheap but it's not unreasonable   Got all the great Asian style drinks boba etc Salt and Fries are good  Any burger will do  Have the Malasadas it's on point
1975	1	Amazing all around. We made reservations 2 months in advanced and now I know why it was so important. This place was packed so be prepared, but they seated us quickly, brought our drinks and food quickly and we all left with a smile. We ordered 13 entrees and all shares Bc we've just heard such great things. The coconut curry with crispy duck, garlic sea bass, pad Thai, green curry, beef and coconut peanut sauce, garlic prawns, soft shell crab drunken noodle and pineapple fried rice were just a few I could remember and it was all phenomenal. Looking forward to coming back here and sharing the experience with whoever I'm with!
1976	1	Hands down the best burger in the east. I went there at 5 5 p.m. Not a lot of people. I ordered a chicken mushroom something something better but they gave me turkey something something Burger when she was still good. But turkey scares the crap out of me, so it was interesting. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place
1977	1	My girlfriend and I had planned a trip to Las Vegas about 6 months ago and Bouchon had been on our list of places to eat since we are a bit on the "foodie" side and really wanted to try a Thomas Keller restaurant. We made reservations for our first night in Vegas which happened to be a Monday evening.   I received a confirmation call earlier in the day which I appreciate. We arrived around twenty minutes early for our 9pm reservation hoping to get a drink at the bar first. Upon arrival, they told us our table would be ready shortly and pointed us to the bar.   The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was as I had suspected it to be. Music playing but not too loud and the decor fit well with the french feel but not too old feeling. The bartenders were quick in getting us a cocktail menu and we were served within minutes of sitting down. The cost of drinks was no more than any other high class restaurant and were delicious. My Bulleit Manhattan was delicious and made perfectly. At 9 o'clock exactly, our table was ready and we were seated.   Our waiter was very nice from the get go and always attentive. He offered up a few suggestions as well. We ended up having a bottle of wine which the sommelier brought to our table. Being big duck fans, we ordered the Confit de Canard which was crispy duck leg with soft yellow polenta, hen-of-the-wood mushrooms & a red wine duck jus. The duck was prepared to perfection and the polenta and mushrooms added some various textures to it with the duck jus giving it a nice bite. We were very pleased.  For our meals, my girlfriend ordered the Gnocci which will melt on your fork if you don't get it in your mouth quick enough and I mean that in a great way. It was probably the best Gnocci I've had. Not too soft and not too hard and the brown butter sauce was simple yet delicious. I decided to mix it up and get chicken which I rarely ever do. It was the waiters suggestion as they are well known for their Poulet Rti. It was worth mixing it up as I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.   Being on vacation, we wanted to try as much as we could so we made sure to save room for dessert. We tried the Profiteroles which while being pretty basic, still hit the spot. I have to give extra points to them as well because they have a Cigar To Go menu with the desserts. Prices weren't too bad either considering what you would pay elsewhere on the strip.  Overall it was a great meal. Service was good. Not exactly memorable but got the job done and had no issues. Food was spectacular if you are looking for a good fine dining cuisine. Ambiance and atmosphere was classy and fun and perfect for Vegas fine dining.  I recommend it and cant wait to try another Thomas Keller restaurant soon.
1978	1	From the amazing food to the wonderful waitress who provided amazing service (while still in training) this restaurant is mandatory!  I love the Eiffel Tower restaurant for dinner, but this is truly a competitor.  It's not a place you want to wander in wearing shorts and a t-shirt (well, I did, as well as many other DefCon attendees), but if you do, you won't get treated any different.  The bar looks like a place I could spend hours at, just because it's so unique and awesome looking.  But the drinks are crafted by some woman who I can only refer to as a Goddess and the kitchen just does an amazing job on the dinners...I'll be back and not soon enough.
1979	0	First off, it's definitely not worth the 2 + hour wait. Wait like a month or so to go when the hype is over. My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't.  After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering.  I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was.  Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad.
1980	0	This buffet is very overpriced especially considering the quality of the food.  Most of the food is average and the rest is below average.  For the price it is more worth it to spend a few extra bucks and go to Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Place or The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan.  5/10 for food, 2/10 for price, 7/10 for staff (some were friendly while others were kinda rude).  Overall, this buffet is not worth going to and there are far better buffets walking distance away that you can go to.
1981	1	I got the sliders My bf splurged and got the kobe burger topped with foie gras and truffles.....  OMG  YUM  Everything was awesome.  Very delicious.    Tip:  Order a few sauces... we tried the chipotle aioli, the red wine reduction, and the somethingelsefrench sauce... and they really were awesome. Awesomely delicious.  To dip fries and burgers into.  Do it, do it.
1982	1	Delicious!!! We came here on our first wedding anniversary. My husband ordered the leg of lamb and I ordered the roast chicken. He declared it was the best lamb he has ever tasted and I said the same about the chicken. He also loved the wine but was disappointed that he couldn't purchase a bottle anywhere because it was made especially for Bouchon. We also had the mussel appetizer which was steamed and served cold with 2 sauces. So simple yet SO delicious. Didn't have room for dessert though. We live in SF so we will definitely be visiting Napa's Bouchon when we get the chance! Service was very attentive. The only thing I was bummed out about was that a large party of adults allowed their kids to play all over the place. They caused a ruckus and were running and rolling all over the floor behind us. Parents didn't say anything and I thought that was really rude of them.
1983	0	Used to eat here it was always my favorite place to eat on the strip. Foods is great but due to my last experience there I'm not sure I'd ever eat there again. This short blonde hair "bitch" who happened to be the hostess that night was being really rude and ignoring my seating requests even though I was going to wait. Then she had the odasity to call me a bitch to another blonde hostess. I'm not sure if she noticed me and my boyfriend were right there... I was sure to get her name before I left MARIAH. As long as she is there I won't be coming back. Ever. Bad customer service and I just don't need that. This Vegas I expect top quality service.
1984	0	Instead of getting the King size bed we had requested when we paid our room deposit, we got stuck with two full size beds which were too small. Our room was located in another building, which they failed to mention. We were not given any map of where the room was located, how to get to it, or any of the amenities. The room smelled like a nursing home, the shower was tiny, and the bathroom sink had hairs in it. I will not return to this hotel.
1985	1	Highlights of milkshakes: #Cereal bowl: vodka, fruit loops, cap'N crunch! #Birthday cake: vodka, birthday cake crumbles, sprinkles #Coffee & donuts: coffee ice cream, cake donut, malt, kahlua, chocolate espresso beans  Each order come in 2 cups: the milkshake cup (fancy glass) and then the flowover milkshake cup (metal bowl), so by buying 1, actually you will get 2 separate cups, meaning: BUY ONE, GET 1 FREE.  Huge portion in each cup. Very delish,  just right sweetness for my taste.  Billionaire burger $32: kobe beef, foei gras, port onion marmalede, trifee, trufle mayo. The most expensive burger ever, but interesting to try.   Service: 4/5 Guests: mixed, but mostly white Cleanness: 5/5 Area: strategic, crowded, in hip place (in front of marquee club- cosmopolitan hotel)
1986	0	we came here for lunch in a large group and were utterly confused by the menu.  like everyone says, it's a restaurant w/ chinese and mexican food, not chinese-mexican fusion.  we started w/ pork buns, shuimai and veg dumplings, and they weren't really authentic.  i then got some cellophane noodle dish w/ 2 prawns in it.  it was pretty good, but at $18, it was kind of outrageous.  my friends who got tacos weren't even full, b/c they were so tiny, but they were like $6.50 each.  we ended up paying $40 a person for a very mediocre lunch.  definitely not worth it.
1987	1	The food here is FANTASTIC. 5 stars, easily.  Calimari : 9 out of 5 stars I'm a stickler when it comes to calimari.. some may say I am on a Holy Grail of sorts-- in search for the PERFECT calimari. Here, it was perfect. Not too salty. Not chewy. And came with a flavorful and creamy sauce. I was in love.  Pasta: 5 stars Generous portion of meat, cheese and pasta with a zesty sauce.  Ambience: 5 stars High-end. Guilded walls. So much attention to details.   Truly an enjoyable experience. A personal favorite of mine!
1988	0	This is a review for the cafe part of Citizens, not the actual restaurant.  Hungry after a night of partying and wanting something of sustenance in our systems before hitting Daylight, our group wandered into Citizens to pick up some food.  Between Boyfriend and I, we got a bottle of water, a fresh fruit bowl and a croissant. And it totaled to just over $16. WHAT. WHAAAT. The bottle of water itself was $5. FIVE DOLLARS. Even my croissant was only $3.50 (ONLY, she says). My poor wallet.  At least the food was okay. The croissant was light, flaky and huge, so I suppose it kind of made up for the price. The fruit was pretty good -- but unless it's spoiled, it's kind of hard to mess that up.  The other members of our group got various salads (I distinctly remember seeing the quinoa salad) and a tuna sandwich. Their food looked pretty good, but I didn't try it. Regardless, I didn't hear any complaints, so I suppose it was decent enough to satisfy our appetites.  Next time, I think I'll just go hunt down either a Starbucks or something instead if I'm craving a croissant. That's just ridiculous.
1989	0	I came here for a friend and I's birthday from Atlanta.... We were treated horribly. Our entire Las Vegas experience has been phenomenal until this. I am a lifestyle blogger and this will def be on my list of things NOT to do. The club is beautiful I wish the security would have been as great. One of the guards actually put his hands on one of my friends..... I was yelled at like I was a man  for not understanding which way to go..... Security guard got directly in my face to the point he spit on me.   I have never had this bad of an experience in ANY club in any city. I suppose they could care less about people having a great experience since they bring in so many patrons. The guest celebrity host Lebron James, I'm sure would have been floored if he knew how badly people were treated.   We should have listened to locals  when they told us not to come here. Better luck tonight!  Naeemah Jade
1990	0	I have never experienced such rude mean service from the security staff. I was there for a bachelorette party this past weekend and holy sht it was beyond packed I'm surprised that the fire department didn't shut this place down. Thankfully we had reserved a table and purchased bottle service everything about the bottle service was fine up until all decided to go downstairs and dance, did I mention how crowded it was.  As we were walking downstairs I was pushed into one of guard the  A$$wipe takes me by the arm and slams me against the wall and starts pulling me thru this maze of a back room. After witnessing how they beat up on some guys I was horrified that they would do the same with me, eventually they asked the meat head that took me back there what i had done and the he said I had given him lip and pushed him, really??? it was an accident I didn't push you I said, after apologizing for something that I didn't do they let me return to the party. I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there.  The next day I woke up with bruises on my arms and on my legs. I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth it this place is way too crowded. I was told that they also took the person who was walking behind me and that they punched him twice.  The only reason why I didn't call the cops was because I didn't want to be the one to ruin the party.
1991	1	I agree with the other reviewers saying this being the best Thai restaurant. This is a must stop each time I come to Las Vegas. Yes, the location is not the best but it appears to be a little better than in the past.  It is not on the strip, but it is well worth the short drive as the line of customers arriving by taxi can attest.   It is not fancy, modern or nicely decorated, but the walls are filled with autographed pictures from the celebrities and famous chefs who have come here to eat.   The foodie magazine awards and reviews on the walls give you something to read while waiting for a seat.  Once seated be ready to listen to the advice from the waiters and be ready to absorb yourself in the wonderful food.  Most tries are the garlic prawns, Thai beef salad and fish and drunken noodles.  Too  bad this place is so popular because now it is harder to get in.
1992	1	Love love love the Grand Lux at the Venetian. My friends and I have started out  many of our Vegas trips with a meal here and usually make many more dining trips here. And we have so much enjoyment when we eat here. The food is good and the portions are large enough to share. My favorite is their Portofino Salad. So delicious. Apparently everyone and their mother loves this place, too. There's usually a wait for a table, all hours of day and night! The service isn't the best here but that's not why we go to the Grant Lux!
1993	1	The hubs was right ~ the best Thai food ever.    The restaurant is unassuming from the outside, but once you step in the doors, a nice wine cellar is the backdrop for the hustle and bustle of a wonderful establishment.    Friendly service.  Super flavorful dishes and moist, tender meats.    We ordered:  - Crispy Rice appetizer - spicy and sour.  Puckering.  Party in my mouth. - Beef Salad - tender beef slices on tasty greens - Chicken Skewers - so dainty and tender.  Not your average chicken skewer. - Duck Curry - tender and lightly crisp duck pieces over noodles with curry.  Star of the show.   All delicious.  Very, very good.  Thanks, Lotus of Siam ~ you guys rock!
1994	0	Why oh why didn't I check the yelp reviews first?  Oh that's right, because I didn't dare risk using anything wireless during hacker conferences.  I hope you don't either.  But I digress.  Definitely watch the flashy handmade noodle show, both stretched and sliced off of a big brick of dough.  They looked appealing but tasted super bland, no matter what sauce or soup they put it in (we tried the beijing pork and black bean sauce specialty and the wonton noodle soup.)  I also got the taro boba (tapioca drink) and it had huge chunks of ice and was more vanilla tasting than taro.  I'm not hating on this place because it's "Americanized," I couldn't care less if it's not what people in Beijing eat.  All I care about is it TASTING GOOD.  Bleh.
1995	1	Food: Food here was great! I had a burger with chili and skinny fries. The chili was not bad, the burger was so tasty, and the fries were great!  Price: Prices here were cheap. There was this really expensive burger on the menu which my group was checking out but most other items were $15 and under.  Service: We were seated immediately and service was not bad.  Atmosphere: Not a super casual place, kind of reminded me of a Red Robin or something.  There also was a bar located directly behind our table. There were also tvs in some of the booths.  Location: Located in Mandalay Bay near Urban Outfitters upstairs.
1996	1	Seriously wow. Was their 2 days ago and wow. Went in about 1230 pm and there was a wait. The lady whipped out her ipad and took our cell number and said wed receive a text when our table was ready.  Maybe just me being a goof but I thought it was super cool! Took about 25 minutes but was expected with the crowd so wandered the casino floor. When we were seated my mouth was watering looking at everyone's food. We sat down and the staff was super friendly. We ordered the onion rings to start and holy heck these were the BEST I've ever had. The crisp on the outside crumbled in my mouth as the onion only gave the slightest of resistance as i bit through it. Soooo good! The house ranch that came with was outstanding as well.  The burger, which was the farmhouse, was simply epic. Let me say this, cheeseburgers are my bliss. Every city I go to I look for an awesome burger place and have had more burgers then probably any other food and this was flat out the best. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium and the egg was fried perfectly! The duck belly bacon was awesome. The fries were good. Not mind blowing but when you have that burger it simply compliments it. Every time I hit vegas I will have to return here. Even my fiance' who is not a hardcore burger person absolutely loved and devoured her classic american hamburger. The place has a good modern hip feel to it. Highly recommend to ANYONE they have a pretty wide array of burger options nothing to crazy just good old burgers and add on's. Do yourself a favor and grab a burger.  The only draw back was due to the wait but was understandable with the crowd. So good!
1997	1	Best Restaurant in Vegas.... Maybe the whole world actually! (Bold statement but I feel it's warranted!)  We arrived around 8:20pm and there wasn't a table available for over an hour. As it was just the two of us, we decided to sit by the bar which is full service with no wait time. I would like to add that we tried to book a table earlier in the day but after being given the number to the casino, then the hotel, we gave up and decided to head on over once we were hungry. Anyway suffice to say if you would prefer a table I would definitely recommend booking, it was jam packed all night. (No wonder!!)  So to start.... The bar tender Oscar is bloody brilliant!!! Friendly, professional and very knowledgable. My husband had a beer and I got a custom made strawberry daiquiri with 1/3 alcohol because I really am a lightweight.   This was hands down the most delicious, we'll made, perfectly balanced cocktail I have ever had in my life. I'm only 32 years old but my gosh, I have been waiting for a drink to love my whole life and now I have found it! The strawberry and lemon mixed beautifully with the gin and then the hint of basil brings it all together!! Seriously. Worth every penny and I kinda wish we could have an oscar clone in our house to teach us how to make perfect drinks!  As we are perusing the menu some delightful breads came out... Still warm.. With a lovely butter. I'm British and my husband is American and our taste buds often differ but we were both delighted! The breads were absolutely divine and a lovely selection.   We shared the pork belly to start - 10/10! I can really appreciate a well cooked pork belly and this was melt in the mouth delicious!  The onion and jam that was served with the pork was perfect. If you had seen us you would have seen the pure joy with every bite. This sounds like an exaggeration doesn't it? It's not. If anything there aren't the words to describe how wonderful it was!   For the main meal I had the lamb duet and my husband had the beef Wellington, guess how they tasted? That's right yelp land. Bloody perfect! America doesn't offer enough lamb dishes if you ask me... Delighted to see that Gordon is offering a traditional British dish (shepherds pie & lamb chops) and taken them to the next level!  I'm confident the beef Wellington  was a delicious as my husband reports -- although my lamb was so good I didn't take a bite of his at all!    We ended out perfect meal with a cheese plate and a delightful sticky toffee pudding. Good on Gordon for adding such a staple British pudding to his menu and elevating it to such a high standard! We were audibly satisfied after the first bite - the ooh and ahh that we made during our meals showed the staff how amazed we were.   My husband rounded off the meal with  johnnie walker blue label neat - and it was the perfect end to the perfect meal.   What else? We have covered the food (to clarify: amazing, 10/10, delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented) .... Let's go with the extras.   Ambience: yes. It's dark and it's loud. Noticed that some other yelpers moaned about the music being too loud.... It is loud but I much prefer hearing some inoffensive music to the sound of other diners chatting!   Staff: I would totally recommend sitting at the bar. I already mentioned how lovely and awesome Oscar is. There was also Tracy and Paul. Both as magnificent and polite and professional. What a quality team! They look clean and tidy and we'll presented (off topic but.... Tracy is beautiful with some wonderful eyebrows!!) they were attentive and not overbearing which is a very fine line being at the bar. I appreciated that they kept our water topped up.   Restrooms: so clean and tidy. I also liked that I was shown to them when asked, rather than being pointed through the crowds.   merchandise: there is a selection of items for sale, displayed very well in the wine rack. I have NEVER in my life bought a tshirt from a restaurant but I will be gladly adorning my Gordon tee, and if they had the red one in men's sizes, my husband would have too.   Overall: I am pretty picky. I am hard to please. I turned to my husband half way through the meal and said - when have I ever loved every single thing about a meal? His reply? Never in your life. THATS right! never before have I been so impressed with a restaurant. We spent $350 and I would happily spend it again tomorrow if we weren't leaving! My husband is going to be away for a year and leaves at the beginning of June. This is our goodbye date in vegas and and this night absolutely made the trip. I am coming back to vegas in  a few weeks to meet with family from the UK and if they don't want to come, I will happily dine at the bar alone. It's that good!   Excellent service Excellent food Value for money Amazing amazing amazing!   My husband and I are pretty big Gordon fans given that he is bloody brilliant! but now? He's pretty much our favorite ever!

What a huge mistake!! It was by far the worst service I have ever had and what makes it so bad is we only had dessert. First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go. The wait staff, they were horrible, no customer service skills what so ever. As we're sitting there waiting for our bill, the waiter finally comes to give it to us. Then sitting there waiting for him to take it, we see him clearing off other tables and taking dishes to the back and he doesn't come back out. So I flag a waiter down and ask him if he could get out waiter, which he said he would. Still no sign of him. So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!! That was by far the worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had!!! Never again will I go there or allow any of my family or friends to go there either

In this case Id definitely like to give people a heads up before they waste anytime at this spot.   I think TAO is probably one of the most overrated clubs on the strip, its super mainstream so everyone knows about it, and because of it everyone and their mom tries to go, AND gets in.  We got there fairly early, just before 12 spent a few mins upstairs at the bar over by the restrooms, just to get a good buzz going. But soon the club began to pack, and we realized our little spot would be the place to stay and dance for most of the night.  First off the club gets obnoxiously packed, to the point you are weaving and dodging people if or when we want to get anywhere. If you want to go to the restroom good luck, the restrooms are located next to the bar and are connected to a smaller space that connects to the back part of the club. It was a nightmare to get through or just exit, security yelling, people standing trying order drinks, trying to use the bathroom, trying to move or exit, a complete mess.  Then if you try and go on the main dance floor, its a joke, they pack you so close you literally have NO personal space, you have someone in back of you, next to you in, front of you. You literally are jumping up and down to the beat because you cant really dance. Security stands at the entrances to the dance floor so as soon as the floor packs, they will deny anyone entry.  We headed to one of the other floors, which was a mission within itself (again to many people), and when arriving were met with the same obstacles as the main floor.    If you are visiting and want to make this one of the clubs you are hopping around to before you hit another club (you got a deal/promotion etc.), by all means go to it. But don't make this your one stop club destination for the night because you will be disappointed.   I love to party, dance and enjoy myself in a great (semi-spacious) atmosphere, TAO will definitely not be on my itinerary whenever I party in Vegas. Ever.
